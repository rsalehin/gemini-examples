I was recently asked how I would build a news agency from scratch if I were to start
today, taking full advantage of the potential that generative AI has in
revolutionizing the industry.
While I won’t pretend to be an expert in the news industry - I do have a well
informed point of view on how to think about generative AI and the potential it has
to change products and experiences. Thinking about this through the lens of a
news organization, I can’t help but feel that the changes could be vast, impacting
both content creation and consumption. Here's my quick take on what I would be
considering when it comes to rebuilding the product strategy from the ground up,
putting generative AI at the center:

1. Streamlining Sourcing and Writing:
Effortless Research: Imagine a tool that makes aggregating information from
various sources seamless - quickly pulling in voice memos, video clips, photos,
user testimonials…anything and everything - then it’s able to extract relevant
facts from these sources, highlighting unique perspectives for a potential story.
This would empower journalists to quickly comb through every possible
source and modality, discovering relevant context and nuances that could
resonate best with their audience, saving precious time and effort while
turning those into a story.

Enhanced Writing: Once all the information has been pulled together,
Generative AI can then assist in drafting different versions of a story, catering
to various audience segments and platforms. From concise summaries to indepth analyses, the technology can adapt the writing style and tone to resonate
with specific readers/listeners/viewers. Furthermore, the generated content
can be created in a style that reflects the unique and personalized tone of each
author.
The key here is that AI wouldn’t replace the job of the writer, but rather augment
their workflows to not only make them easier and faster, but also produce better
content for the readers.

2. Creative Content Remixing:
Multi-Platform Distribution: Once your content is created, generative AI can
help you tailor it for various platforms and formats. A long-form article could
be transformed into a short video for YouTube or TikTok, an infographic for
Instagram, or a concise summary for LinkedIn. This allows you to quickly and
easily reach a wider audience and cater to different consumption preferences
all starting from the same source material.
Personalized Content Experiences: Imagine news articles that can be
instantly converted into audio for listening when you’re on a walk, or turned
into videos with accompanying graphics if you’re a visual learner. Generative
AI can personalize the content experience by adapting to user preferences and
learning over time. This could include summarizing key points, providing
alternative explanations, or even generating quizzes to test comprehension.
The idea here is that a single source of content can be turned into any medium
quickly and easily, allowing you to quickly distribute it across any medium or
platform.

3. User Specific Content:
Intelligent Content Delivery: Forget generic news feeds. Generative AI can
analyze user behavior and preferences to deliver highly relevant content at the
right time and through the preferred channels. Imagine receiving breaking
news alerts based on your interests, or having your daily news digest
customized to your specific areas of focus. While the idea of personalization
isn’t a new one - I think the ease at which we’ll actually be able to live up to
this hype is going to mean it will become an even more integral aspect of how
to “put the user first”.
More Relevant Recommendations: Generative AI can facilitate deeper
engagement with content. Users could ask questions about the content,
request different perspectives, or even explore related topics through AIpowered recommendations. This can lead to longer engagements and deeper
and more meaningful interactions.
The takeaway here is that content delivery will be reimagined by generative AI's
ability to personalize the user experience enabling the tailoring of information and
recommendations, ultimately fostering deeper engagement and satisfaction.

4. Understanding User Goals:
Beyond Content Consumption: If you understand your users’ goals, you can
better tailor their experience. Generative AI can help with both. First, it can
assist with analyzing and understanding user behavior to help figure out what
your users want - are they looking for work-related insights, exploring
personal interests, or simply staying informed on current events? Secondly, it
can take this understanding and help you to tailor the content experience, even
suggesting relevant actions such as connecting with experts, joining online
communities, or exploring educational resources.

The Future is Flexible and Fluid:
Ultimately, the goal here is to foster a more fluid and flexible content ecosystem.
Capturing ideas on the fly through voice memos, images, or scribbled notes, and
then using AI to transform them into polished articles. This both unlocks your
creativity and also streamlines the writing process, allowing journalists to focus on
the core of their work: insightful storytelling from a human perspective.
Generative AI is not just about automating tasks; it's about augmenting human
capabilities and creating a more personalized, engaging, and informative news
experience. By embracing this technology, news companies can not only adapt to
the evolving media landscape but also pioneer a new era of content creation and
consumption.
