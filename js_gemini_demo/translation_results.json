On this particular\nday, however, he rose unusually early. He was having breakfast. I was\nstanding by the fireplace. I bent down and picked up the stick which our\nguest had left the previous evening. It was a thick stick, with a large\nknob carved from wood; beneath the knob was a silver ring, and on it the\ninscription: \"To James Mortimer M.R.C.S. from his friends C.C.H.\", and\nbelow that the date: \"1884\".  Such an old-fashioned, strong stick,\nproviding security, was typically carried by elderly doctors.\n\n-- Well, Watson? What do you think of this stick? What conclusions do\nyou draw? -- he asked.\n\nHolmes was sitting with his back to me; he could not see me, and I\nbehaved so quietly that he could not guess what I was doing.\n\n-- You must have eyes in the back of your head... -- I said.\n\n-- I have a silver teapot in front of me -- he replied -- but tell me,\nWatson, what do you think of our guest's stick? Since he did not find us\nat home and did not explain the purpose of his visit, this involuntary\nsouvenir takes on great significance. I would also like to know what\nimpression you have formed of this man?\n\n-- I believe -- I replied, adhering to my companion's method of\ninquiry -- that Dr. Mortimer is a middle-aged doctor, held in high\nregard; this gift from patients proves it.\n\n-- Good, excellent! -- Holmes commended me.\n\n-- I further believe that he is a country doctor and that he mostly\nvisits patients on foot.\n\n-- Why do you suppose so?\n\n-- Because the stick, although originally nice, is so worn that no city\ndoctor would want to use it. The thick iron ferrule is worn down, which\nshows that the stick was in frequent use.\n\n-- Sound reasoning -- Holmes agreed.\n\n-- Furthermore, the inscription from friends at C.C.H. suggests that the\ndoctor provided assistance to members of some hunting club.\n\n-- Indeed, Watson, you surpass yourself -- said Holmes, lighting a\ncigarette. -- I must admit that your conclusions are correct. I have a\nclever pupil. You have highlighted several completely obscure points.\n\nNever before had Holmes spoken to me in such a flattering manner. I was\npleased with his approval, which I had long striven to earn by applying\nhis method of investigation in criminal cases.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, he took the stick from me and examined it with\nhis naked eye. Then he put out his cigarette, went to the window with the\nstick and began to examine it through a magnifying glass.\n\n-- Interesting, very interesting... -- he said, returning to his favorite\nspot by the fireplace.\n\n-- Did you notice any new detail that could serve as a clue? -- I asked,\nexpecting that nothing important had escaped my vigilance.\n\n-- It seems to me, my dear Watson, that almost all your conclusions were\nwrong. You were only right in one respect, namely, that the owner of this\nstick is a country doctor and that he walks a lot.\n\n-- So I wasn't mistaken?\n\n-- On that point -- no.\n\n-- And on others?\n\n-- Other deductions were false. For example, you claim that the stick is a\ngift from some provincial hunting club. I suspect that it was given to the\ndoctor by pensioners of Charing Cross Hospital (C.C.H.).\n\n-- I admit that this is more likely. What conclusion do you draw from\nthis?\n\n-- You know my method of investigation. Apply it in practice.\n\n-- I can only infer that before settling in the countryside, this doctor\npracticed in the city.\n\n-- I think we can go even further in our assumptions. This gift was\npresented at the moment when Dr. Mortimer left the hospital to start his\nown practice.\n\n-- Probably.\n\n-- What position could he have held in that hospital? -- either a\nconsulting physician or a student-intern. Probably the latter, because a\nhospital doctor, with an established reputation and a large practice, does\nnot leave his position to move to the provinces. Dr. Mortimer left the\nhospital five years ago, as indicated by the date on the stick. At that\ntime he probably finished university, so your conclusion that he is a\nmiddle-aged man falls apart. Dr. Mortimer is just under thirty years old,\nhe is polite, kind, not very ambitious, absent-minded. He has a dog\nsomewhat larger than a dachshund, and smaller than a hound.\n\n\nI laughed incredulously. Holmes sat comfortably in his armchair and\nexhaled clouds of smoke.\n\n-- It will not be difficult to see which of us two is right -- I said,\napproaching the bookcase and taking from it a calendar with a list of\nEnglish doctors and their biographies.  Among the many Mortimers, only\none could be the one we were looking for. I read aloud:\n\n\"Mortimer, James, county doctor in Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devonshire. He was\na student-intern at Charing Cross Hospital from 1882 to 1884. He received\nthe Jackson Prize for a study in comparative pathology entitled: \"Is\ndisease a deviation?\" He is a member of the Swedish Pathological Society,\nthe author of many articles, such as: \"Some examples of atavism\" (printed\nin \"Lancet\" in 1882), \"Are we going with the flow of progress?\"\n(\"Psychological Journal\" 1883). He is the county doctor for the parishes\nof Grimpen, Thorsley and High Barrow”.\n\n-- You see, I was right -- said Holmes. -- I still maintain my hypotheses\nthat Dr. Mortimer must be polite, because only a polite person receives\nsuch gifts from their patients; that he is not ambitious, because\notherwise he would not have left London for the provinces, and that he is\nabsent-minded, because otherwise, instead of a stick, he would have left\nhis calling card.\n\n-- What are your conclusions regarding the dog?\n\n-- His dog used to carry the stick in its teeth; because the stick is\nheavy, it holds it in the middle; there are traces of dog teeth in that\nplace. The teeth are too large for a dachshund, too small for a hound. It\ncould be... yes, it's a pinscher.\n\nHolmes crossed the room and stood in the window frame. There was so much\ndeep conviction in his voice that I could not help but ask him:\n\n-- Why are you so sure?\n\n-- For a very simple reason, that I have this dog before my eyes; it is\nbehind that door, and its owner is ringing the doorbell right now. Please,\nWatson, don't leave the room. He is your colleague, and your presence\nmay be useful to me. An important moment is approaching. Steps are\napproaching that may determine destiny -- evil or good -- we don't know. I\nwonder what Dr. James Mortimer will ask of Sherlock Holmes, a specialist\nin criminal offenses... Please!\n\n\nOur guest entered the room. His appearance surprised me greatly. He did not\nlook like a country doctor. He was tall, slender, had a narrow nose\nprojecting sharply from between piercing eyes, hidden behind dark glasses\nin a gold frame. He was dressed in a long, stained coat, his trousers were\nfrayed. Although still young, he was already stooped; his face expressed\ngoodwill towards people. Upon entering, he immediately saw the stick in\nHolmes' hand and ran towards it with a cry of joy.\n\n-- I'm so glad! -- he exclaimed. -- I wasn't sure whether I left it here\nor at the port office. If I had lost it, it would have caused me great\ndistress.\n\n-- Is it a gift? -- asked Holmes.\n\n-- Yes, sir.\n\n-- From the pensioners of Charing Cross Hospital...\n\n-- Yes, from a few patients. They gave it to me as a wedding souvenir.\n\n-- What a pity -- said Holmes, shaking his hand.\n\n-- What do you regret? -- asked Dr. Mortimer in surprise.\n\n-- It's a pity that you dispelled my conclusions -- was the reply. -- So\nyou say it's a wedding present?\n\n-- Yes, sir. I got married and therefore had to leave the hospital; I had\nto set up a home, to try to establish an independent practice.\n\n-- Well, and now you are gaining fame in the field of science -- I said.\n\n-- I have the pleasure of speaking with Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\n\n-- No, this is my friend, Dr. Watson.\n\n-- Pleased to meet you. I've heard about you many times. Allow me, Mr.\nHolmes, to examine your skull. At first glance I noticed that it is\nunusual: it betrays abilities, I would even say – deductive genius. Such a\nskull would be an adornment of any museum. I admit that I envy you for\nit.\n\n-- You are an enthusiast in your profession, just as I am in mine -- the\ndetective replied -- but I think that you did not come here a second time\nonly to examine my skull...\n\n-- No, sir, although I am glad that I have the opportunity to do so. I\ncame to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognize my own impracticality, and I\nam faced with a very difficult problem. Since you are the second expert in\nEurope in criminal matters...\n\n-- Really? May I ask who is the first?\n\n-- In the eyes of a person who prioritizes theory over practice, Mr.\nBertillon undoubtedly takes first place.\n\n-- So why don't you turn to him?\n\n-- I say that he is first-rate in terms of his seriousness, as a\ntheoretician. But you, as a practitioner, are the first in Europe – that\nis undoubtedly true. I hope I haven't offended you...\n\n-- A little -- replied Holmes half-jokingly -- but as a practical man, I\nwould finally like to know what brings you here.\n\n\nII.\n\nThe Curse of the Baskerville Family.\n\n\n-- I have a manuscript in my pocket -- said Dr. James Mortimer.\n\n-- I noticed it immediately when you entered the room -- replied Holmes.\n\n-- The manuscript is old.\n\n-- From the eighteenth century.\n\n-- How do you know?\n\n-- Half an inch of paper protrudes from your pocket. I looked at it while\nyou were speaking, and I would be a poor expert if I could not determine\nthe date of the manuscript from its external appearance. You have\nprobably read my monograph on this subject. In this case, I think the\nmanuscript dates from 1730.\n\n-- You are mistaken by twelve years. It is dated 1742.\n\nDr. Mortimer took it out of his pocket.\n\n-- This family document was entrusted to my care by Sir Charles\nBaskerville, whose tragic death three months ago shook all of\nDevonshire. I should add that I was his personal friend, as well as his\nfamily doctor. He was a brave, intelligent, practical man and, like me, not\nsusceptible to illusions of the imagination. And yet he sacredly believed\nthe words of this document and was prepared for the kind of death that\novertook him...\n\nHolmes reached for the manuscript and began to examine it carefully.\n\n-- I draw your attention, Watson, to the consistent use of long and short\n_s_. This is one of the clues that helped me determine the date.\n\nI looked over his shoulder at the paper, yellowed with age. On the first\npage was the heading: \"Baskerville Hall\", and below it the date: \"1742\".\n\n-- This is probably a confirmation of some legend -- Holmes interjected.\n\n-- Indeed -- admitted Dr. Mortimer. -- The legend concerns the\nBaskerville family.\n\n-- I suspect, however, that you wish to seek my advice on a more current\nand more real matter -- said Holmes.\n\n-- Yes. I'm concerned about a puzzling event that happened recently; I\nmust solve the riddle within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is\nshort and has a close connection to this matter. So I will read it to you,\nif you will allow me.\n\nHolmes nodded. He sat comfortably in his armchair, folded his hands so\nthat his fingers touched his fingers, closed his eyes and listened with\nresignation.\n\nDr. Mortimer held the manuscript up to the light and read aloud in a firm\nvoice, the following:\n\n-- “Various rumors have circulated about the Hound of the Baskervilles,\nbut I, descending in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville, have heard this\nstory from my father, who in turn heard it from his, so I write it down\nwith complete faith. I would like you, my sons, to become deeply\nconvinced that Justice, punishing guilt, can forgive it, and that no\npunishment is so severe that prayer and penance cannot erase it. Let this\nstory teach you that you should not fear the fruits of the past, but rather\nbe cautious in the future, lest the wild passions for which our family has\nsuffered such a severe punishment should again unleash themselves to our\ndestruction.\n\n“Know then, that during the time of the Great Revolution (I recommend\nthat you read the history of this era, written by Lord Clarendon); in\nthose times, Baskerville Hall was ruled by Hugo, and he was, I must admit,\na hot-headed and godless man.\n\n“Neighbors would have easily forgiven this last transgression, for our\narea was never known for its religiosity, but they could not forgive his\ninnate cruelty.\n\n“Now, this Hugo fell in love (if one can call such a wild feeling that),\nhe fell in love, therefore, with the daughter of the tenant who leased the\nland near the Baskerville estates. But the girl, being modest and\ngod-fearing, feared him like Satan. Now, one autumn day, on the feast of\nSaint Michael, Hugo, at the head of five or six companions, sneaked into\nthe farm and abducted the girl, taking advantage of the moment when her\nfather and brothers were absent.\n\n“They brought the poor girl to the castle and placed her in a tower room,\nHugo and his companions sat down to a night feast, as was their custom.\nHearing their drunken shouts, the girl trembled, but she was brave by\nnature, so she overcame her fear and decided to save herself. A huge birch\ntree sheltered, and still shelters to this day, the window of that corner\nroom. The girl clung to its branches and descended to the ground, and\nhaving gained her freedom, she ran through the meadows and fields to her\nfather's farm, three miles from the castle.\n\n“Shortly afterwards, Hugo, leaving his companions with bottles and cards,\nwent to his victim, and seeing that the bird had left the cage, like a\nmadman returned to the banquet hall, smashed the glass and amidst terrible\ncurses and imprecations swore that he would give his body and soul to the\ndevil if he helped him recover the girl. The drunken companions listened\nto him in terrified silence, only one, worse, or perhaps more drunk than\nthe others, suggested that they should send the yard dogs after the girl.\n\n“Hearing this, Hugo ran out of the house, summoned the stable boys, ordered\nthem to saddle his favorite mare and unleash the hounds; to one, the\nwildest, he gave the girl's handkerchief to sniff, left in the corner\nroom, and rushed across the meadows on a moonlit night.\n\n“The companions of the revelry threw themselves on their horses, grabbed\ntheir pistols and chased after their host, and there were thirteen of them\nin all. The moon shone brightly, they galloped along the road the girl must\nhave taken if she had gone home.\n\n“They had ridden a mile and a half when they saw a night shepherd. They\nasked him if he had seen any Britons. Frightened, he replied that a moment\nago some dogs had been running after a girl.\n\n-- “But I saw something more,” he said. “Hugo Baskerville was riding here\non his black mare, and behind him was running some terrible dog, black, as\nif Satan incarnate. God forbid that I should ever meet such a monster on\nmy path again.\n\n“The drunken companions cursed the shepherd and rode on. They rode another\nhalf a mile. Suddenly, their hair stood on end with fear, for before them\nwas rushing the black mare, covered in foam, without a saddle and without a\nrider.\n\n“The companions huddled together, for their fear was overwhelming, but\nthey rode on, although each of them, if he had been alone, would have\nturned his horse around and fled to the castle, but one was ashamed of\nthe other. Plodding slowly, they finally caught up with the hounds; these,\nalthough known throughout the area for their ferocity, now lay in the\nditch, frightened, and howled terribly.\n\n“The company stopped. The riders sobered up immediately. Some wanted to\nturn back, others decided to find out what had happened. The moon shone so\nbrightly that one could pick up pins.\n\n“A mile further on, in the field, there stood tall stones. Between them\nlay the girl, dead, and beside her Hugo Baskerville -- dead.\n\n“But it was not this sight, though terrible and unexpected, that made the\ndrunken company's hair stand on end; a more terrifying sight presented\nitself to their eyes: above Hugo's corpse stood a black dog, enormous,\nbaring its teeth and flashing its eyes. One of the companions fell to the\nground, struck by fear, another lost his mind, the rest of the riotous\ncompany never forgot this impression to the end of their lives.\n\n“Such is, my sons, the legend of the hound that has plagued our family\nsince that time. I have written it down so that you may know how things\nreally were and not believe the circulating fables. I will not conceal\nfrom you that after this incident, many men in our family died a sudden,\nbloody and mysterious death. However, let us not lose faith in God's\nmercy, which punishes the guilty only to the third or fourth generation.\nTo God's providence, my sons, I commend you and warn you not to cross this\nmeadow at night, when evil spirits are unleashed.”\n\n(These are the warnings of Hugo Baskerville, written for his sons, Roger\nand John, with the order not to mention all this to their sister,\nElizabeth).\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Mortimer finished reading this unusual story, put on his glasses and\nlooked at Mr. Sherlock Holmes. He yawned and threw his cigarette into the\nfire.\n\n-- Well? -- he said.\n\n-- Isn't this story interesting?\n\n-- Certainly, for a collector of old legends and fairy tales.\n\nDr. Mortimer took a newspaper from his pocket.\n",
  "And now, Mr. Holmes,” he said, “I shall show you something more recent.  Here is the *Devon County Chronicle* of May 14th of this year. It contains a description of the facts relating to the death of Sir Charles Baskerville, which occurred a few days before that date.”\n\nMy friend leaned forward and began to listen more attentively. Dr. Mortimer read:\n\n“The recent and sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, the Liberal candidate for the county of Devon, has filled our entire neighbourhood with astonishment and alarm. Although Sir Charles Baskerville had only recently resided at Baskerville Hall, his courtesy, generosity, and nobility had earned him the respect of all who knew him. In this present age of parvenus, it is pleasing to see a descendant of an ancient, though fallen, family regain the fortune of his ancestors and restore lustre to an old name.\n\n“Sir Charles, as is known, acquired a large fortune through speculations in South Africa, and being naturally prudent, he did not further tempt fortune, which can turn away from some as it has done with others, and having realised his fortune, he returned to England.\n\n“He settled at Baskerville Hall barely two years ago; his extensive plans for the renovation of the old manor and the introduction of improvements to the farm are well known. Death prevented their realisation.\n\n“Being childless, he desired that the entire neighbourhood should benefit from his fortune, and more than one neighbour has good reason to mourn his untimely death. We have often reported in these columns on his generous donations to public institutions.\n\n“The investigation has not yet clarified the circumstances surrounding Sir Charles's death. The strangest legends circulate here, attributing this sudden death to the action of supernatural forces.\n\n“Sir Charles was a widower, and was generally considered an eccentric. Despite his considerable fortune, he had simple, modest habits. The domestic staff at Baskerville Hall consisted of a butler, named Barrymore, his wife, and a cook and housekeeper combined. Both testify that Sir Charles's health had been poor lately, that he was developing heart disease, manifested by pallor, shortness of breath, and frequent fainting spells. Dr. James Mortimer, a friend and the deceased's family physician, gave testimony to the same effect.\n\n“Sir Charles Baskerville used to take a walk every evening along the famous avenue of elms before the castle, before retiring to rest. The Barrymores relate that on the evening of the 4th of May, their master informed them that he was leaving for London the following day and ordered his valise packed.\n\n“That evening he went for his usual walk, during which he smoked a cigar.\n\n“He did not return from this walk.\n\n“At twelve o'clock, Barrymore, seeing the front door still open, became worried, and taking a lantern, went to look for his master. It had rained during the day, so it was easy to see Sir Charles's footprints along the avenue.  Halfway along there is a gate leading to the meadow.\n\n“There were signs that Sir Charles had stood there for some time, then turned back into the avenue. His body was found at the end of it.\n\n“Among other things, one fact, resulting from Barrymore's testimony, has not yet been explained, namely, that his master's footprints changed from the moment he stood by the gate and that from then on he walked on tiptoe.\n\n“A certain Murphy, a gypsy horse trader, was then in the meadow, some distance from the deceased, but he admits himself to have been drunk. He says he heard screams, but cannot determine where they came from.\n\n“There were no signs of violence or assault on Sir Charles's body, and although the doctor testifies that the deceased's facial expression was so altered that he, Dr. Mortimer, at first did not recognise him, the experts attribute this to an aneurysm of the heart, in which similar symptoms occur.\n\n“The autopsy revealed a pre-existing heart defect; the coroner confirmed the medical examination. It is desirable that Sir Charles's heir should take possession of the estate as soon as possible and continue the laudable activity so suddenly and tragically interrupted.\n\n“If the prosaic verdict of the coroner and the experts had not put an end to the romantic stories circulating about this death, it would not be easy to find an owner for Baskerville Hall.\n\n“The presumed heir is Mr. Henry Baskerville, son of Sir Charles's younger brother. This young man left for America several years ago. A search has been ordered. He will undoubtedly soon learn of the change in his fortunes.”\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nDr. Mortimer folded the newspaper and put it in his pocket, saying:\n\n“These are the facts, generally known.”\n\n“Thank you for bringing to my attention a truly interesting case,” said Mr. Holmes. “I did read about it in the papers, it is true, but at that time I was preoccupied with the cameos that disappeared from the Vatican Museum. I wanted to help the Pope and lost sight of what was happening in England at the same time. This article, you say, contains facts that are commonly known?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then please inform me now of what no one knows.”\n\nSherlock Holmes leaned against the armrest of the armchair and again folded his hands so that his fingertips touched.\n\n“I shall do so,” said Dr. Mortimer, betraying increasing agitation. “I will tell you what I have not yet told anyone. I concealed it from the coroner for reasons you will surely understand. As a man of science, I did not want to publicly betray my belief in superstition. Further, I understood that if belief in the supernatural forces governing Baskerville Hall were strengthened, no one would want to take possession of the old castle. For these two reasons, I did not testify in court to everything I know – for it would have been useless to the coroner – but I will be completely honest with you.\n\n“The area is sparsely populated, residences are rare, and peasant dwellings are scattered at a considerable distance from each other.\n\n“I often saw Sir Charles Baskerville, who craved company. Apart from Mr. Frankland at Lafter Hall and the naturalist, Mr. Stapleton, there are no intelligent people nearby. Sir Charles was secretive and taciturn. We became close because of his illness, and we were also united by common scientific interests. He brought many interesting findings from South Africa. We spent many pleasant evenings discussing comparative anatomy.\n\n“In the last few months, I noticed that Sir Charles's nervous system was overstrained. He took this legend so much to heart that, although he took his evening walks, nothing could induce him to enter the meadow after sunset. He was constantly haunted by the fear of ghosts, and he often asked me if I had seen some strange creature and if I had heard any barking. He always asked me these questions in a trembling voice.\n\n“I recall one of my visits to him three weeks ago. He was standing in the hall. As I got down from the carriage, I noticed that he was looking over my shoulder with fear in his eyes. I turned around and saw a strange shape, similar to a large, black calf. It darted past my carriage.\n\n“Sir Charles was so agitated that I went to look for this peculiar animal. But it was nowhere to be found. My patient could not calm down. I stayed with him all evening, and then, explaining his agitation, he told me the whole story.\n\n“I mention this minor episode because it takes on significance in light of the tragedy that followed; at the time, I did not attach much importance to it and was surprised by Sir Charles's agitation.\n\n“He was to go to London on my advice. I knew he had a heart condition and that constant anxiety was bad for his health. I thought that a few months spent on entertainment would free him from these anxieties and apparitions. Our mutual friend, Mr. Stapleton, was of the same opinion. And then the misfortune occurred.\n\n“Immediately after Sir Charles's death, the butler, Barrymore, sent for me via groom Perkins; I arrived at Baskerville Hall an hour after the catastrophe. I examined all the facts presented at the inquest. I followed the footprints left in the Elm Avenue, examined the place by the gate where Sir Charles had stopped, and I realised that from that point he had walked on tiptoe and that there were no other footprints except Barrymore's later ones. Finally, I carefully examined the body, which remained untouched until my arrival.\n\n“Sir Charles lay on his back with outstretched arms; his face was so altered that I could barely recognise him. There were no injuries on the body. But Barrymore made one false statement during the inquest. He said there were no marks around the body. He did not notice them, but I did – quite fresh ones, nearby.”\n\n“Were they footprints?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Male or female?”\n\nDr. Mortimer looked at us for a moment with strange eyes, then replied in a whisper:\n\n“Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints… of a dog… a huge one.”\n\n\nIII.\n\nThe Enigma.\n\n\nI admit that as I listened to this story, shivers ran down my spine. And the doctor was visibly moved.\n\n“You saw these tracks?” I asked.\n\n“Yes, with my own eyes; as clearly as I see you now.”\n\n“And you said nothing?”\n\n“Why should I?”\n\n“Why didn't anyone else notice these tracks?”\n\n“They were about two feet from the body; they were not noticed, and I would not have noticed them if I had not known the legend.”\n\n“There are many dogs in the area.”\n\n“Yes, but this was no ordinary dog. I have already told you that it was enormous.”\n\n“Didn't it approach the body?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Was the night clear?”\n\n“No; cloudy and damp.”\n\n“But it wasn't raining?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“What does the avenue look like?”\n\n“It is planted with two rows of elms and bordered by a twelve-foot-high hedge. The avenue itself is eight feet wide.”\n\n“Is there anything between the hedge and the avenue?”\n\n“Yes; a six-foot-wide lawn runs on both sides.”\n\n“As far as I understand, there is an entrance through a gate?”\n\n“Yes; the gate leads to the meadow.”\n\n“Are there any other entrances?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“So, to enter Elm Avenue, one must either leave the house or go through the meadow?”\n\n“There is a third entrance through the gazebo, at the other end of the avenue.”\n\n“Did Sir Charles reach this gazebo?”\n\n“No; he was found fifty feet from it.”\n\n“Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer – this will be an important detail – were the tracks you observed on the gravel or on the grass?”\n\n“I couldn’t see any tracks on the grass.”\n\n“Were the tracks on the same side as the gate?”\n\n“Yes, on the same side.”\n\n“You are greatly intriguing me. One more question. Was the gate locked?”\n\n“Locked and bolted.”\n\n“How high is it?”\n\n“About four feet.”\n\n“So it could easily be climbed over?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And what traces did you find by the gate?”\n\n“None that would attract attention.”\n\n“Didn't you examine the ground around?”\n\n“Yes, I did.”\n\n“And you didn't see any traces?”\n\n“They were very indistinct. Sir Charles obviously stood there for five to ten minutes.”\n\n“How do you know that?”\n\n“Because cigar ash fell twice onto the ground.”\n\n“Excellent. We have found a colleague after our own hearts. Isn't that true, Watson? But what kind of traces were they?”\n\n“Footprints on the gravel. I couldn't see any other marks.”\n\nSherlock Holmes struck his knee with his hand.\n\n“Why wasn't I there!” he exclaimed. “This is a very interesting incident, providing ample scope for scientific expertise. Why couldn't I read this gravel card before other footprints erased it! Dr. Mortimer, why didn't you inform me sooner! If we fail to solve this case, the entire responsibility will fall on you.”\n\n“I couldn't call you, Mr. Holmes, because then I would have had to reveal these facts to the whole world, and I have already said that I didn't want to. Besides… besides…”\n\n“Why don't you finish?”\n\n“There are areas inaccessible even to the most astute and experienced detectives…”\n\n“Do you mean that this falls into the realm of the supernatural?”\n\n“I don't claim that definitively.”\n\n“But you think so deep down.”\n\n“Since that tragedy, facts have come to my attention that contradict the general laws of nature.”\n\n“For example?”\n\n“I am learning that before this catastrophe, several people saw an unusual creature in the meadow, similar to the Baskerville ghost. Everyone says it was a huge, transparent dog. I questioned these people – one of them is a peasant, another a blacksmith, a third a farmer. Their testimonies are identical. Superstitious fear has gripped the entire neighbourhood. No one will cross the meadow at night.”\n\n“And you, a man of science, believe in such fairy tales?” exclaimed Holmes.\n\n“Until now, my studies encompassed the sensory world; I tried to fight disease, but I cannot fight evil spirits. Besides, you must admit that the footprints are material evidence. Hugo's dog was not a supernatural phenomenon either, since it could bite to death, and yet it had something satanic about it.”\n\n“I see that you have joined the ranks of the spiritualists. But tell me one more thing, Dr. Mortimer. If you are inclined towards such beliefs, why did you come to seek my advice? You say in one breath that it is not worth investigating the murder of Sir Charles, and at the same time you ask me to take on this case.”\n\n“I didn't ask for that.”\n\n“Then how can I help you?”\n\n“By advising me what to do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who is arriving at Waterloo station –” Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch – “in an hour and a quarter,” he finished.\n\n“Is he the heir?”\n\n“Yes. After Sir Charles's death, we sought information about this gentleman and learned that he has a farm in Canada. According to our information, he is a blameless young man. I am not speaking now as a doctor, but as the executor of Sir Charles's will.”\n\n“Are there no other candidates for the inheritance?”\n\n“None. It could only be Roger Baskerville, the youngest of the three brothers, of whom Sir Charles was the eldest. The second brother, who died prematurely, was the father of this Henry. The third, Roger, was a prodigal son, a living spiritual likeness of old Hugo. He caused so much trouble in England that he could no longer stay here; he fled to Central America and died of yellow fever in 1876. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles. In fifty minutes I am to meet him at Waterloo station. I had a telegram informing me that he arrived in Southampton today. And now, Mr. Holmes, tell me, what do you advise me to do?”\n\n“Why shouldn't Sir Henry return to his father's house?”\n\n“It seems natural, and yet, if we consider that every Baskerville who resides there meets a sudden and violent death… I am certain that if Sir Charles could speak to me before the catastrophe, he would forbid me to bring the last of the family to that cursed residence. On the other hand, the prosperity of the entire neighbourhood depends on the heir residing at Baskerville Hall. The whole work begun by Sir Charles will come to naught if no one lives in the castle. I fear that the good of this neighbourhood might lead me to act disloyally towards Sir Henry, and therefore I ask you for advice.”\n\nHolmes pondered for a long time.\n\n“So,” he said, “according to your conviction, some unclean force threatens the Baskervilles in those parts. You truly believe in this?”\n\n“I am prepared to assume that this is so.”\n\n“Then this unclean force can torment Baskerville just as well in London as in Devonshire. A devil whose actions would be localised would not be dangerous.”\n\n“You are trying to ridicule my fear, Mr. Holmes. But if you yourself saw these supernatural things, you would give up your jokes. From your words, I gather that this young man is just as safe in London as in Devonshire. He is arriving in fifty minutes. What do you advise me to do?”\n\n“I advise you to take a cab, call the dog that is howling outside the door, and go to Waterloo station to meet Sir Henry Baskerville.”\n\n“And then?”\n\n“And then you will tell him nothing until I have thought about it.”\n\n“How long will you need to think?”\n\n“Twenty-four hours. I ask you, Dr. Mortimer, to visit me tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. And please bring Sir Henry Baskerville with you. This will make it easier for me to carry out my plan.”\n\n“I will do as you wish.”\n\nThe doctor noted the time on his cuff and left. Mr. Holmes stopped him on the stairs.\n\n“One more question,” he said. “You say that before Sir Charles's death several people saw this phenomenon in the meadow?”\n\n“Yes, three people.”\n\n“Did any of them see it afterwards?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Thank you. Goodbye.”\n\nHolmes returned to his seat. He was visibly pleased.\n\n“Are you leaving, Watson?” he said.\n\n“Do you need my help?”\n\n“No, my dear fellow. I will only ask for it at the moment of action. An exceptional case. As you pass Bradley’s, please stop at the shop and have them bring me a package of the strongest tobacco. If you can, I would be very grateful if you didn’t return before evening, and then we shall compare our impressions and opinions.”\n\nI knew that solitude was essential to my friend at moments when he was pondering the clues of criminal cases, when he was drawing conclusions and forming theories that always proved correct. So I spent the whole day at the club and only returned to the Baker Street flat around nine o'clock.\n\nWhen I opened the door, it seemed to me that there had been a fire in the apartment; the lamplight appeared as if behind a black mist. After a moment I realised that the smoke came not from fire, but from strong tobacco. Amidst the clouds, I saw Holmes in a dressing gown. He sat in an armchair with a pipe in his mouth. Several rolls of paper lay on the table. I coughed.\n\n“Have you caught a cold?” he asked.\n\n“No, but one could suffocate here.”\n\n“Open the window. I see that you spent the whole day at the club…”\n\n“How do you deduce that, Holmes?”\n\n“You are fresh, fragrant, and in a good mood. You will never guess where I have been.”\n\n“I won't rack my brains over it. You will tell me yourself.”\n\n“So, I was in Devonshire.”\n\n“In your thoughts?”\n\n“Yes. My body remained here, in this armchair, and consumed two enormous pots of coffee and countless amounts of tobacco. After you left, I sent for a map of the area from Stamford and wandered over it all day. I flatter myself that every inch of the land is now well known to me.”\n\n“That must be a large-scale map?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe unfolded it and laid it on his lap.\n\n“You see,” he said, “here is the meadow, and here is Baskerville Hall.”\n\n“Surrounded by forest.”\n\n“Indeed. And here is Elm Avenue, to the left of the meadow. Here is Grimpen village, where Dr. Mortimer has taken up his main quarters. Within a five-mile radius there are few human dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall. Here – the naturalist Stapleton's cottage. Here are two farms: High Tore and Fulmire. Fourteen miles further – the Princetown state prison. Around and in between – meadows and bogs. This is the terrain on which this tragedy unfolded. We will try to recreate all its scenes and acts.”\n\n“A deserted area.”\n\n“Yes. The devil could have settled there…”\n\n“So you too are inclined towards supernatural explanations…”\n\n“The devil's servants can be people of flesh and blood. First of all, two questions must be resolved: firstly, was there a crime? Secondly, how was it committed? If Dr. Mortimer is not mistaken, if it turns out that we are dealing with supernatural forces, then judicial inquiries are useless. But we must exhaust all other hypotheses before we reach that conclusion. Would you close the window? I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps focus the mind. Did you consider this matter during the day?”\n",
  "I\n\n-- I thought about her a lot. She's really strange.\n\n-- There are distinguishing characteristics. For example, the change in footprints.\n\n-- Doctor Mortimer explained it this way: Sir Charles later walked on tiptoe.\n\n-- The doctor only repeated what some fool said at the inquest. Why would Sir Baskerville walk on tiptoe? No, he simply ran, _fled_, until he finally fell face down on the ground.\n\n-- From what was he fleeing?\n\n-- That's what needs to be revealed! There are indications that he was already frightened before he started to run.\n\n-- How do you know?\n\n-- I suspect something he saw in the moor frightened him. That sight robbed him of his senses, because otherwise he wouldn't have fled in the opposite direction, instead of running towards the mansion. If the gypsy's testimony is credible, – while running, he called for help, but he ran away from where help couldn't possibly come. Furthermore: who was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting in the Avenue of Elms, instead of at home?\n\n-- So you think he was waiting for someone?\n\n-- He was elderly, ill. He could certainly have gone for a walk, but not on such a night, dark and damp. Why did he stand for five to ten minutes by the gate, as Doctor Mortimer concluded from the cigar ash?\n\n-- Didn't Sir Charles go out every evening?\n\n-- I doubt he stood by the gate for ten minutes every evening. We even know that he used to avoid the moor. On the contrary, that evening he waited near it. It was the eve of his departure to London. Things are starting to clear up. My dear fellow, hand me the violin. Let's talk about something else. Let's leave this matter alone until the arrival of Doctor Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville.\n\n\nIV\n\nSir Henry Baskerville\n\n\nWe had an early breakfast. Holmes was waiting for the announced visit. Our clients arrived punctually. It was just ten o'clock when Doctor Mortimer entered the drawing-room, followed by the young baronet.\n\nThe latter was short, powerfully built, about thirty years old, with dark hair and eyes; thick black eyebrows gave his face a determined, even stern expression. His whole bearing and tanned complexion showed that he had spent a lot of time in the fresh air; he looked like a perfect gentleman.\n\n-- This is Sir Henry Baskerville, – Doctor Mortimer introduced him.\n\n-- Yes, I am here in person, and what is even stranger, Mr. Holmes, is that if my friend hadn't suggested this visit, I would have come to you myself.\n\n-- Please sit down. Has anything unusual happened to you since your arrival in London?\n\n-- I've been made fun of. I received this letter this morning.\n\nSir Henry placed an envelope on the table; we all leaned over it. It was an ordinary grey envelope; the address: _Sir Henry Baskerville_, _Northumberland Hotel_ – was typed, with a Charing Cross postmark and the date from the previous evening.\n\n-- Who knew you were staying at the Northumberland Hotel? – Holmes asked, looking sharply at his client.\n\n-- No one could have known. I only decided after meeting Doctor Mortimer.\n\n-- Doctor Mortimer was already staying there, perhaps?\n\n-- Not at all. I stayed with a friend, – the doctor replied. – There were no clues indicating that we intended to stay at this particular hotel.\n\n-- Hm! Someone is evidently following your steps.\n\nHolmes took a large sheet of paper from the envelope and unfolded it on the table. In the middle of the sheet was a single sentence. It read:\n\n    _If you value your life, beware of the moor_\n\nOnly one word: \"moor\" was typed in capital letters, in ink.[A]\n\n-- Now, Mr. Holmes, – said Sir Henry Baskerville – perhaps you can explain to me what these words mean and who is interested in my person?\n\n-- What do you think of this, Doctor Mortimer? You must surely agree that there is nothing supernatural about it.\n\n-- No, but these words could have been written by someone who believes in the supernatural force governing this matter.\n\n-- What matter? – Sir Henry Baskerville interrupted. – I see that you gentlemen are better informed about my affairs than I am.\n\n-- Before you leave here, Sir Henry, you will know what we know, – Sherlock Holmes declared. – In the meantime, let's deal with this interesting document. The letter was posted and dropped into the box last night. Do you have yesterday's _Times_, Watson?\n\n-- It's here.\n\n-- Please give it to me. I want to see the inside column with the leading article.\n\nHe ran his eye down the column.\n\n-- The leading article is about free trade. Allow me to read one passage from it:\n\n“It should not be deluded that the protective tariff will protect our industry. Such a law will only reduce the circulation of capital and make life more expensive in England. Therefore, if you care about your well-being, dear citizen, beware of voting for the proponents of this idea.”\n\n-- What do you think of this, Watson? – Holmes exclaimed, rubbing his hands with delight. – Don't you find that the expressed views are very profound?\n\nDoctor Mortimer looked at Holmes with curiosity; Sir Henry was visibly surprised.\n\n-- I don't know about tariffs, – he said – but I don't see how these words are supposed to lead us to the author of the letter.\n\n-- Oh yes, Watson knows my system. Did you understand the meaning of this sentence for our case?\n\n-- I admit that I don't see any connection between these words and the warning contained in the anonymous letter.\n\n-- And yet, my dear Watson, the connection is so close that one follows from the other. _Life_, _value_, _beware_ – don't you see where these words are taken from?\n\n-- You're right! – exclaimed Sir Henry.\n\n-- Any doubts are dispelled by the fact that the words were cut out entirely, not individually by letters, and we even see two words cut out together: _value your_...\n\n-- Really, Mr. Holmes, it's beyond comprehension! – said Doctor Mortimer, looking at my friend with amazement. – Not only did you immediately recognize that the words were cut out of a newspaper, but you guessed which one. Tell us, how?\n\n-- I think you, Doctor, could distinguish a Negro skull from an Eskimo skull?\n\n-- Naturally. Skull examination is my specialty.\n\n-- For my eyes, the difference between the _bourgeois_ font of the _Times_ leading articles and the _petit_ print of evening papers is as great as for you between an Eskimo and a Negro skull. Studying prints is elementary detective knowledge.\n\n-- Presumably, these words were cut out with a penknife.\n\n-- No; with scissors, and very sharp and short ones. After cutting them out, they were glued to the paper with gum.\n\n-- But why was the word: _moor_ written by hand?\n\n-- Because it's not in the article.\n\n-- Did anything else catch your attention, Mr. Holmes? – Sir Henry asked.\n\n-- I notice a few clues, although attempts were made to erase all traces. The address typed in an unskilled hand, but the _Times_ is read by intelligent people. I conclude from this that the author of the anonymous letter is an educated person who wants to appear uneducated; the very fact that he conceals his handwriting proves that you know, or that you could recognize that handwriting. Furthermore, the words are not glued in a straight line; for example, _life_ is not in its proper place. This indicates carelessness or excitement. I suspect the latter. The correspondent was clearly in a hurry... but why? He knew that the letter, posted in the evening, even at the latest, would reach Sir Henry's hands the next day before he left the hotel. Did this stranger fear that his work would be interrupted?\n\n-- We are now entering the realm of conjecture, – Doctor Mortimer interjected.\n\n-- Say rather, the field of probabilities. You may call it conjecture, but I am certain that the address was written in the hotel.\n\n-- How do you know that?\n\n-- If you gentlemen examine it carefully, you will notice that the writer had trouble with the pen and ink. The pen splattered twice in one word, and dried three times while writing such a short address, which proves that there was very little ink in the inkwell. Now, in a private house, it is rare for the ink to dry out and for the pen to be in such bad condition. But you know what hotel pens and inkwells are like. I think that by examining the inkwells in hotels near Charing Cross, we will find the cut-out number of the _Times_ and we will be able to find the person who sent this letter.\n\nHe carefully examined the paper to which the words were glued, but could not see anything unusual.\n\n-- Has anything else happened to you since you arrived in London? – he asked Sir Henry.\n\n-- Nothing at all.\n\n-- Haven't you noticed anyone following you?\n\n-- No. Who would want to follow me? No one knows me here.\n\n-- Didn't you have any surprises?\n\n-- None. Except that one of my boots is missing.\n\n-- You lost a boot? How did that happen?\n\n-- You'll probably find it when you get back to the hotel. It's not worth bothering Mr. Holmes with such trifles, – Doctor Mortimer interrupted him.\n\n-- I beg your pardon; it's not a trifle, – the detective contradicted. – How did it happen?\n\n-- I put both boots outside my door for cleaning. The next day there was only one. The attendant didn't know what happened to the other one. I bought these boots yesterday and I didn't wear them at all.\n\n-- If you didn't wear them, why did you give them for cleaning?\n\n-- The boots passed through so many hands in the shop that they need cleaning.\n\n-- So yesterday, after arriving in London, you did some shopping?\n\n-- I did a lot of shopping. Doctor Mortimer was with me. Because I must confess that, leading a free life in the fresh air, I neglected myself a bit, and it was necessary to prepare for playing the role of a gentleman of numerous estates. Among other things, I bought these yellow boots, I paid six shillings for them. But they stole one before I even put them on.\n\n-- That's strange. What good is one boot? – Sherlock Holmes wondered.\n\n-- Now, gentlemen, – said the baronet – I await the fulfillment of the promise. I would like to know what you have been hiding from me.\n\n-- Your request is justified, – Holmes replied. – Doctor Mortimer, I think you have a duty to tell Sir Henry what he told us.\n\nEncouraged, the doctor took papers from his pocket and presented the whole matter to the new baronet.\n\nSir Henry Baskerville listened attentively, occasionally interrupting with cries of surprise.\n\n-- Ha! I see that I have inherited an estate to which some revenge is attached, – he finally said when the story came to an end. – Of course, I've heard about that hound since time immemorial, even from my nannies. However, until now I didn't attach any importance to this legend. Now I see that the death of my uncle was indeed accompanied by mysterious circumstances. You gentlemen yourselves don't yet know whether this matter falls under the jurisdiction of the police or the pastors. And on top of that, I receive this enigmatic letter...\n\n-- It shows that someone is watching the moor and the surrounding wasteland and bogs, – said Doctor Mortimer.\n\n-- And that someone is ill-disposed towards you, otherwise the other person would have no reason to warn him of the danger.\n\n-- Or perhaps, for reasons known to them, they want to drive Sir Henry away from here.\n\n-- That's possible, and I am grateful to you, Doctor Mortimer, for suggesting this thought to me. Currently, the question is whether Sir Henry should or should not go to Baskerville Hall?\n\n-- Why shouldn't he?\n\n-- It seems that you are in danger there.\n\n-- Are you talking about danger from people, or from the four-legged enemy of the Baskervilles?\n\n-- Our investigations will reveal that.\n\n-- Be that as it may, I am determined. There is no such devil in hell, nor such a man on earth, who would prevent me from living in the house of my ancestors.\n\nWith these words, Sir Henry frowned, sparks flew from his eyes. Apparently, the bold spirit of the Baskervilles had not died out in the last descendant of the family.\n\n-- Now, – he continued – I must reflect on what I have learned. I would like to have an hour to think. It's half past twelve. I'm going back to the hotel. Could you gentlemen come to me for breakfast at two o'clock? Then I will be able to tell you what I think about all this.\n\n-- Very well. We will be there at the appointed time.\n\n-- Goodbye then.\n\nAfter our guests left, Holmes jumped up and exclaimed:\n\n-- Watson, get your hat and stick. There's no time to lose.\n\nHe ran out of the room in his dressing gown; a minute later he appeared in his overcoat. We rushed down the stairs. On the street we saw Sir Henry and Doctor Mortimer a few hundred meters ahead of us. They were walking towards Oxford Street.\n\n-- Should I catch up with them and stop them? – I asked.\n\n-- Heaven forbid! – he replied. – Your company is quite enough for me. These gentlemen are doing well to take a walk. The day is fine.\n\nHe walked at an accelerated pace, until the space between us and them was halved; then, keeping a hundred feet away from them, he followed them through Oxford Street all the way to Regent Street. Our friends stopped once in front of a shop window. Holmes also stopped. After a moment he uttered a quiet cry of satisfaction. I looked in the direction of his gaze and saw that a cab with a man sitting in it, which had stopped on the other side of the street, was driving on again.\n\n-- Come on, Watson. We must take a look at him.\n\nI noticed a black, bushy beard and eyes boring into us through the cab window. At that moment, the window in the cab went up, the stranger said a few words to the driver, and the cab quickly sped towards Regent Street.\n\nHolmes looked around for another one, but there were none available. He hurried on foot, but the cab was going so fast that it was impossible to catch up with it. Soon it disappeared from our sight.\n\n-- Damn it! – my friend cursed. – That's how we messed up! Unforgivable!...\n\n-- Who was that? – I asked.\n\n-- I have no idea.\n\n-- Surely a spy.\n\n-- From what I heard from Baskerville, I suspect that someone has been following him since his arrival in London, because otherwise, how would they have known so quickly that he stayed at the Northumberland Hotel? And if they were following him on the first day of his stay, they will undoubtedly continue to follow him. You probably noticed that while Doctor Mortimer was reading, I looked out of the window twice.\n\n-- I noticed that.\n\n-- Well, I was looking to see if anyone was standing on the opposite side of the street; but there was no one. I'm dealing with a cunning fox, and although I can't yet figure out whether this stranger wants Sir Henry's ruin or wants to save him from danger, I feel that he must be reckoned with. After Sir Baskerville left, I rushed out to see his shadow. But this man got into the cab, thinking that this way he would not attract attention.\n\n-- That leaves him at the mercy of the cab driver. It's a pity we didn't notice the number, – Watson remarked.\n\n-- My dear fellow, do you think I could have overlooked such an important detail? I remembered the cab number... 2704. But in the meantime it's useless. I made a big mistake... Instead of following the cab from the front, I should have turned around and got into the first available cab behind it. This way we could have followed it, or have ourselves taken directly to the Northumberland Hotel and wait there. Excessive zeal was a big mistake. Our opponent did not fail to take advantage of it.\n\nWe walked slowly through Regent Street. Doctor Mortimer and his companion had long since disappeared from our sight.\n\n-- It's not worth following them, – Holmes said. – That one has already escaped and probably won't appear again. We must use the threads we hold in our hands. Did you remember the stranger's face?\n\n-- I only remembered the beard.\n\n-- Me too; I conclude from this that it was false. Let's go in here.\n\nWe entered the hotel. The manager greeted Holmes with great joy.\n\n-- As I see, you remember, Wilson, the small favor I had the opportunity to do for you, – my friend said.\n\n-- I will never forget it. You saved my honor and my life.\n\n-- You're exaggerating, my dear fellow. After all, you have an attendant named Cartridge here, who showed a lot of ingenuity during the investigation.\n\n-- Yes; he's still with us.\n\n-- Could you call him? Thank you. And I would also like to change a five-pound note.\n\nA fourteen-year-old boy, nimble, cheerful and quick-witted, appeared in the hall. He stood before the detective in a respectful posture.\n\n-- Please give me a list of hotels. Thank you. Look, Cartridge: here are the names of twenty-three hotels near Charing Cross. Do you see?\n\n-- Yes, sir.\n\n-- You will visit each of them in turn.\n\n-- All right, sir.\n\n-- You will start by giving a shilling to the porter. Here you have twenty-three shillings.\n\n-- All right, sir.\n\n-- You will say that you need yesterday's newspapers, that you are looking for an important announcement that was supposed to be placed in one of them, but you don't know – which one.\n\n-- I understand, sir.\n\n-- In fact, you will be looking for the number of the _Times_, in which a few words were cut out with scissors. Here is one copy. On this page. Do you recognize it?\n\n-- I recognize it.\n\n-- Each time, the porter standing at the door will call the porter sitting in the hall – and you will give him a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. Surely, 20 times you will hear that yesterday's newspapers were burned; in three hotels they will give you a whole pile; you will look for that number of the _Times_ among them. You probably won't find it. Here are ten shillings for unforeseen expenses. Send me a telegram before evening to Baker Street. And now, Watson, we must find out about cab No. 2104, then we will visit the picture gallery on Bond Street, to fill our time until two o'clock.\n\n\nV.\n\nThree broken threads.\n\n\nSherlock had an extraordinary ability to turn his thoughts in any direction at will. For an hour and a half he forgot about this strange affair; he was absorbed by the paintings of modern Belgian masters, he spoke only about art, on which he had very original views.\n\nAt the appointed hour, we stood in front of the Northumberland Hotel.\n\n-- Sir Henry Baskerville is waiting for you on the first floor, – said the porter.\n\n-- May I look at your guest list? – Holmes asked.\n\n-- Certainly.\n\nThe book showed that two people stayed at the hotel after Sir Henry's arrival: a certain Theophilus Johnson with his family, who arrived from Newcastle, and Mrs. Oldmore with her maid, from High Lodge, Alton.\n\n-- I think I know this Johnson, – Holmes said to the porter. – Isn't he a lawyer: grey-haired, limping?\n\n-- On the contrary: this Mr. Johnson is a coal mine owner, very active, about your age.\n\n-- You are mistaken about his profession.\n\n-- Not at all. We have known him for over ten years; he always stays with us.\n\n-- Ha! In that case, I was mistaken. Mrs. Oldmore?... That name is also familiar to me. Forgive my curiosity, but I would like to know if she is my acquaintance.\n\n-- She is an elderly, frail person. Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester. She always stays with us.\n\n-- Thank you for the information. I see that it's someone else. I don't know this lady...\n\nAs we went upstairs, my friend whispered:\n\n-- We already know that the person who is interested in Sir Henry's fate did not stay at this hotel. Although he follows him, he is afraid of being followed. This is a very significant fact. But... what happened?...\n\nWhen we entered the first floor, Sir Henry ran towards us, visibly agitated. He held an old boot in his hand.\n\n-- They're making fun of me in this hotel! – he shouted – but I'll teach them a lesson! If the boot isn't found, they'll remember me here!\n\n-- You're still looking for the boot?\n\n-- Yes, but I won't let this go!\n\n-- You said the boot was yellow, didn't you?\n\n-- Yes; they took my yellow one first, and now the black one. I only had three pairs: new yellow ones, old black ones, and these patent leathers. Yesterday one of the yellow pair disappeared, and today one of the black pair. Well, what? Did you find it? Speak.\n\n\nA frightened German attendant stood before us.\n",
  "I did not find it,\" he replied in a trembling voice. \"I searched everywhere, but it vanished without a trace...\"\n\n\"Listen: if that boot isn't found before evening, I'll tell the manager and leave the hotel.\"\n\n\"It will be found! I promise you it will be found.\"\n\n\"Remember! I apologize, Mr. Holmes, for this scene.  Although it's a trifle, I've lost my patience.\"\n\n\"It's not a trifle at all...\"\n\n\"I see you're concerned about this loss. How do you explain it?\"\n\n\"I don't understand anything yet; however, it's strange, like everything that's happened to you since your return to the country. But we already have a few threads in hand, and I expect that one or the other will lead us to the discovery of the truth. We may waste some time following a false trail, but sooner or later, we'll find the right one.\"\n\nBreakfast passed very merrily. We didn't talk about the matter; only when we returned to Sir Henry's apartment did he announce his decision.\n\n\"I'm going to Baskerville Hall,\" he declared.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"At the end of the week.\"\n\n\"Ha! You may be doing well. I would do the same. I am increasingly convinced that you are being spied upon here, and among the millions of people gathered in the capital, it is difficult to detect your persecutors, or guardians. If they have evil intentions towards you, they can carry them out before we can prevent it. You probably don't know, Doctor Mortimer, that you were followed today when you left the house?\"\n\nDoctor Mortimer was surprised.\n\n\"Who spied on us?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, I can't say. Among your acquaintances and neighbours in Dartmoor, is there a man with a very large, black beard?\"\n\n\"No... Oh, right... Barrymore, Sir Charles's butler, has a large, thick, black beard.\"\n\n\"Really? Where is Barrymore now?\"\n\n\"He's guarding the manor.\"\n\n\"We should check if he's not amusing himself in London.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Give me a telegraph form. I'll write: 'Is everything ready for the arrival of Sir Henry Baskerville?' I'll address it to 'Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall.' What's the nearest telegraph station?\"\n\n\"Grimpen.\"\n\n\"At the bottom, I'll add a note: 'Telegram to be delivered to Mr. Barrymore. If absent, please return the telegram to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.' By evening we will know if Barrymore is at his post in Devonshire.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" said Sir Henry. \"But tell me, Doctor Mortimer, who is this Barrymore?\"\n\n\"He's the son of the deceased key keeper. For four generations they have served the Baskerville family and guarded the manor. As far as I know, the present Barrymore and his wife are very respectable people.\"\n\n\"They have a comfortable living, little work, and the whole manor at their disposal, since the owners rarely stay there.\"\n\n\"That's true.\"\n\n\"Was Barrymore mentioned in Sir Charles's will?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"Both he and his wife received five hundred pounds each.\"\n\n\"Indeed?... Did they know they would receive it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Sir Charles liked to talk about the provisions in his will.\"\n\n\"That's a very interesting detail.\"\n\n\"I hope you won't look suspiciously at everyone who received legacies from Sir Charles, because he left me a thousand pounds,\" said Doctor Mortimer.\n\n\"Really? To whom else?\"\n\n\"There are a few legacies for small sums and a large bequest for charitable purposes. The rest of the capital went to Sir Henry.\"\n\n\"How much is that?\"\n\n\"740,000 pounds sterling.\"\n\nHolmes raised his eyebrows in surprise.\n\n\"I didn't expect the sum to be so high,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Sir Charles was considered wealthy, but even we had no idea he was so rich. The entire estate, including property, is worth over a million pounds.\"\n\n\"Really? Such money can arouse desire and lead to crime. One more question, Doctor Mortimer. Assuming that some misfortune befalls our friend – forgive me for this sad hypothesis – who would then inherit the estate?\"\n\n\"Since Roger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother, died unmarried and without children, the estate would pass to distant relatives, the Desmonds. Jack Desmond is an elderly man, serving as a pastor in Westmorland.\"\n\n\"Thank you. These details are very important to me. Do you know Jack Desmond?\"\n\n\"I do. He once visited Sir Charles. He is a pious man, of great merit and great selflessness. I remember he didn't want to accept any allowance from Sir Charles, even though he begged him to.\"\n\n\"So this man, of such modest requirements, would become the heir to a huge fortune?\"\n\n\"Yes, unless the current owner disposes of the capital otherwise.\"\n\n\"Have you made a will yet, Sir Henry?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Holmes. I haven't had the time. I only learned the situation yesterday. But, in any case, I believe the money should go with the land. That was my uncle's wish. The owner of Baskerville Hall couldn't maintain the residence in its former splendor without cash. The manor, the land, and the money must be in one hand.\"\n\n\"You're right. I also completely share your opinion in another respect, finding that you should leave immediately for Devonshire. But you can't go alone.\"\n\n\"Doctor Mortimer is coming with me.\"\n\n\"Doctor Mortimer will be busy with his practice, besides, he lives a few miles from the manor. Despite the best intentions, he wouldn't be able to help you if needed. No, Sir Henry, you must take a trusted person with you, someone who will not leave your side.\"\n\n\"Would you like to come with me, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"If necessary, I will be there immediately, but now I have an important matter and cannot leave London. A representative of a first-rate family is being tormented by a rogue and exploiter. I must prevent a scandal.\"\n\n\"Can you recommend someone in your place?\"\n\nHolmes put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"If my friend is willing to accompany you,\" he said, \"you could not trust anyone more than him.\"\n\nThe proposal completely surprised me. Before I could answer, Baskerville extended his hand to me.\n\n\"I hope you won't refuse me,\" he said. \"If you would do me this favor, I will be grateful to you for the rest of my life.\"\n\nI have always been attracted to unusual adventures, and besides, I was flattered by the eagerness with which Sir Henry accepted this proposal.\n\n\"I will go with pleasure,\" I replied.\n\n\"And you will report everything to me,\" said Holmes. \"When the crisis comes, which is inevitable, I will tell you how to proceed. I think you will be ready to go in a few days.\"\n\n\"I can leave on Saturday,\" I declared.\n\n\"So we will meet at 10:30 at Waterloo Station,\" said Sir Henry.\n\nSuddenly he cried out in surprise. He ran to the bed, bent down, and from under the bedside table pulled out a yellow boot.\n\n\"I have my lost property!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"May all unpleasantness be removed as quickly,\" Sherlock Holmes wished him.\n\n\"But it's strange!\" noted Doctor Mortimer. \"I thoroughly searched the whole room before breakfast...\"\n\n\"And so did I,\" added Sir Baskerville.\n\n\"The boot wasn't there then.\"\n\n\"The servant probably put it there during our absence.\"\n\nWe sent for the German, but he claimed to know nothing and could not explain this strange event.\n\nSo another mystery added to the series of small secrets, following each other so quickly. Not counting the death of Sir Charles, within two days we went from one surprise to another, racking our brains: over the printed letter, over the appearance of spies, over the disappearance of the yellow, then the black boot. Finding the yellow one was a new sensation.\n\nHolmes remained silent, driving with me to Baker Street; from his lowered brows I guessed that he was weighing all these circumstances in his mind and drawing conclusions from them. Throughout the afternoon, until evening, he sat in a cloud of smoke.\n\nJust before dinner, two telegrams were delivered to him: The first read:\n\n\"I have been informed that Barrymore is in place.\n\n                                    Baskerville.\"\n\nThe content of the second telegram was as follows:\n\n\"I visited twenty-three hotels indicated, but I couldn't find that _Times_.\n\n                                    Cartwright.\"\n\n\"So both my threads are broken,\" said Holmes. \"Nothing excites me as much as failure. We must look for another way.\"\n\n\"There remains the cab driver who drove the stranger.\"\n\n\"I telephoned the police station to find out his name. Someone is ringing. Could it be the answer?\"\n\nIt was more than that. The cab driver himself entered the room.\n\n\"I was informed by the police that someone living at this address inquired about No. 2704,\" said the man with a kind face. \"I've been driving for seven years and no one has ever complained about me, so it surprised me very much, and I came to find out what you have against me.\"\n\n\"I have absolutely nothing against you, my friend,\" replied Holmes, \"actually, I have half a sovereign for you if you can answer my questions clearly and precisely.\"\n\n\"It seems to be a good day today,\" whispered the cab driver. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"First of all, give me your address, just in case.\"\n\n\"John Clayton, Turpey Street No. 3. I stand with my cab at Shipley Yard, near Waterloo Station.\"\n\nSherlock Holmes wrote it down.\n\n\"Now, Clayton, tell me everything you know about the gentleman who stood under this house at ten o'clock this morning, and then told you to follow two gentlemen through Regent Street.\"\n\nThe cab driver looked at him in surprise.\n\n\"What am I supposed to tell you when you know everything yourself,\" he replied. \"That gentleman told me he belonged to the police, that he was a detective, and told me to keep quiet.\"\n\n\"My friend, the matter is very important, and you may find yourself in a difficult situation if you keep what you know to yourself,\" said Holmes. \"So that gentleman told you he was a detective?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And when did he tell you that?\"\n\n\"When he got out of the cab.\"\n\n\"Did he mention his name?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHolmes gave me a triumphant look.\n\n\"That was very careless,\" he said. \"What's his name?\"\n\n\"Sherlock Holmes.\"\n\nI had never seen my friend so astonished. He lowered his head and was silent. Finally, he burst out laughing.\n\n\"What a cunning fox! He made a fool of me. I like them! He said his name was Sherlock Holmes?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good. Now tell me where he got into the cab and what happened next?\"\n\n\"He called me at half past nine in Trafalgar Square. He immediately said he was a detective and offered me two guineas if I would follow his orders all day and ask no questions. I readily agreed. First, we went to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out. They got into the cab. We followed them; they got out somewhere near here.\"\n\n\"Did they enter this house?\"\n\n\"I don't remember exactly, but my passenger saw and remembered. We stopped nearby and waited for an hour and a half. Then those gentlemen passed us by; my passenger told me to drive slowly through Baker Street, and then through Regent Street, halfway. Then the gentleman lowered the window and shouted for me to drive straight to Waterloo Station, as fast as the horse could go. I spurred the horse, and we arrived in ten minutes. When he got out, he turned to me and said: – 'You may be curious to know who you were driving? I am Sherlock Holmes'.\"\n\n\"And you didn't see him afterwards?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What did this Mr. Sherlock Holmes look like?\"\n\nThe cab driver scratched his head.\n\n\"He's not easy to describe. He was about forty years old, of medium height, a couple of inches shorter than you, decently dressed, had a large, black, pointed beard, and was very pale.\"\n\n\"What kind of eyes did he have?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"You don't remember anything else?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Here's your half sovereign; you'll get the other half if you tell me something more. Goodnight.\"\n\n\"Goodnight sir, and thank you.\"\n\nJohn Clayton left, pleased.\n\n\"The third thread is broken!\" exclaimed Holmes. \"He's a clever rascal! He knew where I lived, what business Sir Henry came to me for; he recognized me on Regent Street; he guessed that I noticed the cab number, that I would bring him in, and that's why he gave my name. I tell you, Watson, we have a formidable opponent. I've been checkmated in London. I wish you better luck in Devonshire. I feel guilty sending you there. It's a dirty business. We can laugh, but let me tell you, I'd like to see you back here already.\"\n\n\nVI.\n\nBaskerville Hall.\n\n\nSir Henry Baskerville and Doctor Mortimer were ready to go, and on the appointed day we set off for Devonshire. Sherlock Holmes drove me to the station and gave me his final advice and instructions.\n\n\"I won't confuse your own judgment by giving you my suspicions,\" he said. \"I only want you to report the facts to me with the greatest detail. Leave the drawing of conclusions to me.\"\n\n\"What facts do you want to know?\" I asked.\n\n\"I want to know everything that happens, even if it seems to have no connection with our case; I especially want to know the young Baskerville's relations with the neighborhood, and all details concerning Sir Charles's death. One thing seems certain to me, namely, that Mr. Jack Desmond, the closest heir, is a selfless man and that he was not the perpetrator of the murder. We can completely ignore him. Let's look among Sir Henry's closest circle.\"\n\n\"Shouldn't we first get rid of the Barrymores?\"\n\n\"That would be very careless. If they are innocent, they would be wronged; if they are guilty, it would make it easier for them to cover their tracks. No! We must keep an eye on them, but not let them out of our sight. There's also the _groom_. There are two tenants near the moor. There's Doctor Mortimer, but he seems completely honest; there's his wife, about whom we know nothing. Then there's Mr. Frankland from Lafter Hall and some other neighbors. You must carefully observe all these neighbors to accurately assess their character, their goals, their preferences, etc.\"\n\n\"I will do everything in my power.\"\n\n\"Do you have a weapon with you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I took a revolver, just in case.\"\n\n\"Let it not leave you day and night; be ready to defend yourself.\"\n\nOur friends had already found a first-class compartment and were waiting on the platform.\n\n\"We have no news,\" replied Doctor Mortimer in response to Holmes' question. \"I am only sure of one thing, and that is that we haven't been followed for the last two days. We always went out under the care of an undercover policeman, who didn't notice anything suspicious.\"\n\n\"I hope you gentlemen stayed together?\"\n\n\"Almost constantly; yesterday, in particular, I spent the whole afternoon at Sir Henry's in the surgical museum,\" replied Doctor Mortimer.\n\n\"That was very careless,\" said Holmes thoughtfully. \"Please, Sir Henry, never go out alone, because great misfortune may befall you. Was the other boot found?\"\n\n\"It vanished completely.\"\n\n\"Goodbye,\" said Holmes as the train started – \"and remember, Sir Henry, one sentence from that legend: after sunset, avoid the moor and the adjacent bog.\"\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe journey was pleasant; I spent my time getting to know my companions better and playing with Doctor Mortimer's dog.\n\nAfter a few hours, the fields turned green; through the carriage window, we could see grazing livestock. Young Baskerville watched the landscape with visible pleasure, especially when we entered his native Devonshire.\n\n\"Since I left it, I've traveled around the world,\" he said, \"and I haven't seen anything like it anywhere.\"\n\n\"All Devonshire citizens share your opinion,\" I interjected. \"No area evokes such great attachment in its inhabitants as this one.\"\n\n\"It depends on the race,\" explained Doctor Mortimer. \"Just look at Sir Henry's round skull to know that he is of Celtic origin, and Celts have an innate passion and ability to become attached to people and their country. Poor Sir Charles's head was half Gallic, half Celtic. After all, Sir Henry, you left Baskerville Hall at a very young age?\"\n\n\"I was only ten years old when my father died. Besides, I don't know the manor; we lived in a secluded manor house on the south coast. From there I went straight to America. This whole country is as foreign and new to me as it is to Doctor Watson, and I would like to see the moor and the adjacent bog as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Your wish has already been fulfilled.\"\n\nDoctor Mortimer pointed through the window to a vast empty space.\n\nIt was a sad, gloomy sight. Baskerville looked at it with emotion, as at a battlefield where the tragic fates of his family were played out.\n\nIn his drawn brows, in the outline of his lips, one could see unwavering will and energy.\n\nThe train stopped at a small station. We got off the train. On the other side of the station, an American carriage, drawn by two strong horses, was waiting for us.\n\nOur arrival was apparently the event of the day, as we were surrounded by porters, and the station master with his staff looked at us curiously. I was struck by the sight of two tall soldiers in uniform; they stood, leaning on their rifles, and did not take their eyes off us.\n\nThe driver, with a stern face, greeted Sir Henry with a bow. We took our seats in the carriage; the horses galloped quickly; we passed neat farms surrounded by gardens, but in the distance, there were still scorched fields.\n\nThe American carriage drove onto a side road; we sped through fertile meadows and cultivated fields. At every turn, revealing new horizons, Baskerville uttered quiet cries of delight. We passed an oak grove; the fallen leaves littered the path for the new heir. This could be considered a bad omen...\n\n\"Hello! What does this mean?\" exclaimed Doctor Mortimer as we drove onto the field.\n\nA soldier on horseback, with a bayonet over his shoulder, stood as if rooted to the ground.\n\n\"What does this mean, Perkins?\" Doctor Mortimer asked again.\n\nThe driver turned to us and said:\n\n\"Three days ago, a prisoner escaped from Princetown prison; all roads and stations nearby are guarded by the military. Our farmers don't like it.\"\n\n\"They should be happy. The police pay well for information about fugitives. You can earn a few pounds.\"\n\n\"But you can also lose your head, because such a one will not forgive and will cut the throat of anyone who leads the police to his trail.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"His name is Seldon. He was imprisoned for murder in Notting Hill.\"\n\nI remembered the case well, because Holmes was interested in it because of the murderer's extraordinary cruelty. His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment: he was declared insane; the judges couldn't believe that he committed such a monstrous crime while in his right mind.\n\nOur American carriage was now rolling along the edge of the bog, studded with tall stones. The sight was menacing. Even Sir Henry stopped admiring the landscape.\n\nThe fertile area remained behind us; before us lay grey, barren land; human dwellings, surrounded by stone walls, appeared only occasionally. Finally, we drove into a deep ravine; the green of the trees reappeared, and in the distance, two towering towers appeared. The driver pointed with his whip.\n\n\"That's Baskerville Hall,\" he announced.\n\nThe owner of this residence, with sparkling eyes, looked at his seat.\n\nA few minutes later we were already entering the manor gate, old-fashioned and arched; after a while, the building appeared before us, rebuilt with Sir Charles's South African gold.\n",
  "The rattle of wheels ceased on the withered leaves; old trees formed a tunnel above our heads. Baskerville shuddered, seeing this avenue.\n\n-- Was it here?... -- he asked in a low voice.\n\n-- No; the Avenue of Elms is on the other side -- explained Doctor Mortimer.\n\n-- No wonder my uncle had bad premonitions. This leafy tunnel could fill even the bravest man with fear. I'll illuminate it with electric lamps. In six months this courtyard will be unrecognizable.\n\nWe passed the dark avenue, and via a wide, ascending driveway, arrived before the palace.\n\nThe central section was adorned with a magnificent portico; on either side rose medieval towers, crenellated, with loopholes.\n\n-- Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to the home of your ancestors in Baskerville Hall!\n\nWith these words, a tall, pale man emerged from under the portico and opened the carriage door. A woman stood behind him; she was helping him remove the suitcases.\n\n-- Allow me to leave without getting out, to drive home -- said Doctor Mortimer. -- My wife is waiting for me.\n\n-- What? You don't want to stay for dinner?\n\n-- I would gladly stay and show you around this residence, but Barrymore will do it better than I. I must return. Goodbye! And please remember that I am at your service at any time of day or night.\n\nThe carriage rolled back down the dark avenue. Sir Henry crossed the threshold, I followed him.\n\nWe found ourselves in a huge, vaulted hall, with oak beams. A fire burned in an old-fashioned fireplace. We both stretched out our chilled hands, and after warming ourselves, we scanned the walls, hung with armour, guns, and hunting trophies.\n\n-- This is exactly how I imagined this seat -- said Sir Henry. -- A typical residence of an English nobleman. When I think that my ancestors lived here for five centuries, I'm overcome with a strange emotion.\n\nBarrymore, having taken the suitcases to our rooms, returned and stood by the door, like a seasoned servant, unwilling to interrupt our conversation.\n\nHe was a middle-aged man of unusual beauty, with a pale face, a large black beard, and regular features.\n\n-- Shall I serve dinner, sir? -- he asked.\n\n-- Is it ready?\n\n-- Ready. You will find hot water in your dressing room. My wife and I will try to please you until you find new servants.\n\n-- So you want to leave me?\n\n-- Circumstances have changed. The two of us were enough for Sir Charles, but you will probably want to live more elegantly, receive guests, and will need more servants.\n\n-- So you want to leave me? -- repeated Sir Henry. -- Your family has served mine for several generations. I would be sorry to start a new life by breaking such a long-standing relationship.\n\nI thought I saw emotion on the butler's cool face.\n\n-- We will be sorry too -- he replied -- but we were both very attached to Sir Charles; his death shook us to the core. This house evokes such sad memories that we would prefer to leave it.\n\n-- What do you intend to do?\n\n-- We would like to start some business. Sir Charles's generosity has provided us with the means to do so. Perhaps you would like to see your residence.\n\nAbove the hall was a glazed gallery. Double stairs led to it. Two corridors led from this gallery to the bedrooms. Mine was next to Sir Henry's bedroom. This part of the house was evidently an addition: bright rooms, modernly furnished, equipped with all conveniences.\n\nIn a moment we went down to the dining room. It was a high, old-fashioned room, divided into two parts: in one, which was entered by three steps, in former times the suzerains dined, and in the lower one – the vassals. The vaulted ceilings added even more solemnity to this room, which, in the light of torches, amidst the hubbub of the feast, was sometimes bright and cheerful, but now, in the light of a lamp illuminating two gentlemen in tailcoats, seemed an anachronism.\n\nAll four walls were adorned with portraits of ancestors, starting from knights from Elizabeth's time, and ending with the penultimate owner of Baskerville Hall.\n\nWe spoke little, and I admit I was glad when dinner was over and we could go to the billiard room for a cigar.\n\n-- Not a very cheerful residence... -- said Sir Henry. -- I suppose one can get used to it, but for now I feel uneasy. No wonder my uncle became an eccentric. Let's go to bed earlier. Perhaps tomorrow, in the sunlight, these rooms will seem more cheerful to us.\n\nBefore retiring, I raised the blind and looked out the window. The view was of the lawn in front of the portico. Two oaks stood in the middle, tossed by the wind. The moon, in its last quarter, shone faintly through the clouds. Naked rocks were visible in the distance, and beyond them a bog.\n\nI lowered the blind, not wanting to look any longer at this gloomy landscape.\n\nI was tired, and yet I could not sleep; I tossed and turned. Downstairs, the clock struck the quarters; otherwise, there was a deathly silence.\n\nSuddenly it was broken by a woman's weeping. I sat up in bed and began to listen. For half an hour I waited intently, but besides the weeping I heard nothing at all.\n\n\nVII.\n\nStapleton from Merripit House.\n\n\nThe freshness of the next morning dispelled the gloomy impression the Baskerville residence had made on us both. In the light of the sun's rays, sliding over the old armour, the dining room seemed more cheerful when we sat down to breakfast.\n\n-- I see it was our mood, not the manor, that was to blame -- said the baronet. -- Yesterday we were tired from the journey, chilled, so everything appeared to us in a gloomy light. Today we are refreshed, rested, so the house seems more cheerful.\n\n-- Yet not everything was a figment of our imagination -- I replied. -- Did you hear the weeping yesterday?\n\n-- Indeed, it seemed to me that I heard a mournful wailing. I strained my ears, but the weeping ceased; so I was sure I was dreaming.\n\n-- I heard the weeping very clearly and I could vouch that it was a woman weeping.\n\n-- We must check this -- declared Sir Henry.\n\nHe rang for Barrymore and asked him for an explanation of this riddle. It seemed to me that the butler's pale face paled even more.\n\n-- There are only two women in the house -- he replied. -- The milkmaid, who sleeps in the other wing, and my wife. As for my wife, I can guarantee she wasn't crying.\n\nAnd yet, in saying this, he was lying.\n\nAfter breakfast, I met Mrs. Barrymore in the hall. The sun fell on her face, cold, flat, and ugly. Her large, expressive eyes were red; she looked at me from under swollen eyelids.\n\nSo it was she who wept in the night; her husband certainly knew about it. Yet he denied it to us. What was his purpose? Why was she crying?\n\nThis pale man with the black beard seemed suspicious to me. He was the first to find Sir Charles's body; we only knew what Barrymore had told us about the circumstances surrounding his death. I began to suspect that he, Barrymore, was hiding in the carriage and following Sir Henry. The beard was similar. Although, according to the description of the driver, the alleged Sherlock Holmes was shorter, but descriptions are often inaccurate.\n\nThis had to be checked. But how? First of all, it was necessary to find out from the postmaster in Grimpen whether the telegram had been delivered to Barrymore's own hands.\n\nIn the afternoon Sir Henry wanted to take care of his correspondence; I could go to Grimpen. It was a short walk, the road led along the edge of the bog.\n\nIn Grimpen there were only two brick buildings: an inn and Doctor Mortimer's house. The postmaster also ran a grocery store.\n\n-- Naturally -- he replied to my question -- the telegram was delivered to Mr. Barrymore, as requested.\n\n-- Who delivered it?\n\n-- My boy. Listen, James, didn't you deliver the telegram to Mr. Barrymore at Baskerville Hall last week?\n\n-- Yes, father.\n\n-- To his own hands? -- I asked.\n\n-- He was in the attic then, so I couldn't deliver it to him personally, but I gave the telegram to his wife, who said she would take it to her husband immediately.\n\n-- Did you see Mr. Barrymore?\n\n-- No, sir; I already said he was in the attic.\n\n-- If you didn't see him, how do you know he was in the attic?\n\n-- His own wife must have known where he was -- the postmaster interjected. -- Didn't he receive the telegram? If there was a mistake, let Barrymore himself lodge a complaint.\n\nFurther questions would have been useless. Despite Holmes's lead, we did not obtain certainty that Barrymore was not in London then. He, who last saw Sir Charles alive, may have wanted to be the first to see his new master.\n\nBut what could have been his motive in persecuting the Baskerville family?\n\nI recalled the strange warning cut from the _Times_’ introductory article. Who sent it? He, or someone who wanted to thwart his plans?\n\nPerhaps the butler wanted to secure for himself a peaceful and independent position in the palace, where in the absence of the owners he was the real master?...\n\nBut such a motive would be an insufficient cause for murder.\n\nHolmes himself said that he had never encountered such a complicated case. I already longed to hand it over to my friend as soon as possible.\n\nThe flow of my thoughts was interrupted by the sound of footsteps. Someone was running after me and calling my name.\n\nI turned around, sure that I would see Doctor Mortimer, but to my surprise, I saw a stranger.\n\nHe was a short man, with a shaved face, dark hair combed smoothly; he might have been thirty-five to forty years old. A tin can hung over his shoulder; in one hand he carried an insect net.\n\n-- Forgive my intrusion, Doctor Watson -- he said, running up to me breathlessly -- but here, on these sands, we live without ceremony. Introductions take place naturally. You've already heard about me from our mutual friend, Doctor Mortimer. I am Stapleton from Merripit House.\n\n-- I would have recognized you by the net -- I replied, for I know that Mr. Stapleton is a naturalist -- but how did you recognize me?\n\n-- I was at Mortimer's and he showed me you through the window. Since I'm going in the same direction, I caught up with you. Has Sir Henry already rested after his journey?\n\n-- Completely.\n\n-- We all feared here that the new baronet, after the tragic death of Sir Charles, would not want to live here. He is making a sacrifice by burying himself in such seclusion; but the area will benefit from it and should be grateful to him. I expect Sir Henry does not harbor superstitious fears?\n\n-- He's too sensible for that.\n\n-- Of course, you've already heard the legend of the hound that haunts this family?\n\n-- I have.\n\n-- It's strange how credulous the local villagers are: each of them is ready to swear that they have seen the hound with their own eyes.\n\nMr. Stapleton said this with a smile, but it was evident from his eyes that he believed these rumors.\n\n-- This legend affected Sir Charles's imagination -- he continued -- and I'm sure it brought about his sudden death.\n\n-- How so?\n\n-- Sir Charles was so nervous that the appearance of the hound could kill him. I think he actually saw some strange creature in the Avenue of Elms... I always feared an aneurysm of the heart, because I was very attached to him.\n\n-- How did you know about the heart defect?\n\n-- From my friend, Doctor Mortimer.\n\n-- So you think some hound chased Sir Charles and that the poor fellow died of fright?\n\n-- Do you know any other reason for his death?\n\n-- I am not drawing conclusions yet.\n\n-- And has Mr. Sherlock Holmes already expressed his opinion on this matter?\n\nI was surprised by this question. It could be taken as a trap, but the speaker's face was cool and indifferent, so my suspicions had to vanish.\n\n-- It's no wonder that I know your relationship with the famous detective -- said Mr. Stapleton. -- It is common knowledge that you are friends. When Doctor Mortimer mentioned your name to me; I immediately guessed that Mr. Sherlock Holmes had taken this case into his hands and that you had come here on his behalf. It's natural that I would like to know what Mr. Sherlock Holmes thinks about it.\n\n-- I cannot enlighten you in this regard.\n\n-- Does he intend to visit our area?\n\n-- For the moment he cannot leave London; more important matters occupy his time and attention.\n\n-- What a pity! He might shed light on this mystery... If you need any pointers, I'm ready to help. Perhaps you can tell me how you intend to conduct the case, and who knows, whether I could not give you some help...\n\n-- I came here to visit my friend, Sir Henry, and I don't need any help.\n\n-- You are cautious. That's commendable! -- said Stapleton -- and I have been punished for intrusiveness and will not renew the offer, made with a sincere heart and in the best intentions.\n\nWe reached the path leading across the sands and bogs. To the right stood a fragment of rock; beyond it, at some distance, smoke rose from a chimney.\n\n-- This path leads to Merripit House -- said Stapleton. -- Perhaps you will honour me with your visit?\n\nI wanted to refuse for Sir Henry's sake, but I remembered that he was busy with his correspondence; I could not help him, and on the other hand, Holmes had told me to get to know the neighbourhood. So I accepted Mr. Stapleton's invitation and we entered the path together.\n\n-- This is a strange bog -- he said, pointing to the vast expanse covered with sand and grass -- to an untrained eye it seems monotonous and sad, but whoever gets used to these sandy waves; for them they have an irresistible charm, and they contain so many secrets!...\n\n-- You have explored them?\n\n-- I have lived here for only two years. The locals might call me a foreign newcomer. We settled here shortly after Sir Charles arrived, but my natural inclinations lead me to constant wanderings, so I have come to know almost every inch of this land. I think no one here knows it better than I do.\n\n-- Is the area so difficult to explore?\n\n-- Very difficult. You see, for example, this vast plain to the north, framed by hills. Do you notice anything unusual?\n\n-- I see that one could gallop across this plain.\n\n-- Many have paid with their lives for such a desire. Do you see the green patches with which this plane is dotted?\n\n-- These are probably clumps of grass.\n\nStapleton laughed.\n\n-- This is the so-called Grimpen Mire, impassable mud. One wrong step, and death is certain. No further than yesterday, I saw with my own eyes how a young foal sank into it. The bog swallowed it up. It is dangerous to venture here even in the summer drought, but during the autumn thaws this place is a graveyard, and yet I can safely pass through and return from the very middle of the swamp. You see?... another foal is stuck in the mud...\n\nIndeed, I saw something struggling; after a moment a long neck emerged and a terrible cry rang out. I shuddered. My companion was cooler than I.\n\n-- It's all over for him! -- he said. -- The bog has swallowed him. Two foals in two days! It's dangerous to venture into these bogs.\n\n-- But you cross them unscathed? -- I interjected.\n\n-- Yes; after long wanderings I have found a couple of safe paths.\n\n-- What did you have to gain by crossing these bogs?\n\n-- Do you see those hills in the distance? They are like islands, cut off from the world. Rare shrubs grow there and unusual butterflies fly. It's worth the effort for such specimens.\n\n-- And I will try.\n\nHe looked at me with surprise.\n\n-- May God protect you from such attempts! I would have your life on my conscience! -- he exclaimed. -- You would not return from this trip. Plants serve as my guide.\n\n-- What is that?... -- I exclaimed.\n\nA barking sound came from afar. It was impossible to tell where this terrible sound came from.\n\nStapleton looked at me with an enigmatic expression on his face.\n\n-- These bogs are strange, aren't they? -- he said as if with pride.\n\n-- What is that? -- I asked.\n\n-- The villagers say it's the Baskerville hound demanding its prey. I've heard this voice a few times, but never as clearly as today.\n\nNo living creature was visible around.\n\n-- You are an educated man. Surely you don't believe in superstitions? How do you explain these sounds? -- I asked.\n\n-- Hardened mud, cracking, sometimes makes such groans -- he replied.\n\n-- No, no; it was the voice of a living creature.\n\n-- Have you ever heard the call of a bog bird called a bittern?\n\n-- No.\n\n-- It's a specimen that has already disappeared, but it may have survived here. Anything is possible in such bogs. I wouldn't be surprised if this voice was the call of the last bittern in Europe.\n\n-- Be that as it may, I have never heard a similar sound in my life.\n\n-- Yes, this wilderness contains many strange things. Look at that hill. What do you see?\n\nThe entire slope was dotted with round, shapely stones.\n\n-- What is that? -- I asked.\n\n-- These are the dwellings of our venerable ancestors. Prehistoric man densely populated these bogs, and since no one has lived here since those times, their caves have remained untouched. One can see beds, stools, bowls...\n\n-- From what era?\n\n-- Neolithic, probably.\n\n-- What did these people do?\n\n-- They grazed herds on the hillsides, drained the bogs, and made weapons and tools from stone. Yes, this bog is an interesting page of history. But excuse me...\n\nStapleton suddenly stopped and followed some rare butterfly specimen. He chased it diligently, jumping, spinning around.\n\nAmusing myself with this naturalistic _intermezzo_, I decided to wait for the result of the chase. Then the sound of footsteps reached me again. I looked around and saw a woman walking towards me.\n\nShe was walking from Merripit House. I immediately guessed that it was Miss Stapleton, for I had heard of her extraordinary beauty. Indeed, even in the capital such beauty would have attracted attention, and she was simply dazzling in this wilderness. I was all the more amazed that Miss Stapleton was a complete contrast to her brother. While he was pale and slender, she was splendidly developed; while he was inconspicuous, she was elegant. He had grey hair and eyes, and pale complexion – she was a brunette so strong that one does not see such in England. She had remarkably regular features, fiery eyes, exquisitely shaped lips, and a complexion with a warm blush. She seemed like a miraculous, supernatural phenomenon against the background of the gloomy landscape. Her eyes ran anxiously after her brother, she quickened her pace and caught up with me. I raised my hat and wanted to introduce myself, but she did not let me speak.\n\n-- Leave here!... -- she whispered. -- Go back to London immediately....\n\nI looked at her in amazement. Her eyes blazed, her foot struck the ground.\n\n-- Why should I go back? -- I asked.\n\n-- I can't explain it to you -- she replied in a hushed voice -- but for God's sake, heed my advice. Leave here and never come back.\n\n-- But I have only just arrived...\n\n-- Why won't you understand that this warning is for your own good? Once again I repeat: go back to London immediately, this evening. Leave these parts. Quiet!... My brother is coming. Don't say a word to him about it... Please pick me a few orchids from that clump of grass -- she said in a completely different voice. -- We have many wild orchids. I like this flower.\n\nStapleton stopped his chase and returned breathlessly.\n\n-- Where did you come from, Beryl? -- he asked sharply.\n\n-- I see you are tired -- she said.\n\n-- Yes, I was chasing a butterfly. A beautiful specimen; it is rarely encountered, especially in autumn.\n\nHe said it lightly, but he looked at his sister inquisitively and menacingly.\n\n-- You have met, I see -- he said. -- Introductions are unnecessary.\n\n-- Yes; I just asked Sir Henry to pick some orchids for me.\n\n-- So you are taking Mr...\n\n-- I thought it was Sir Henry Baskerville -- she interjected.\n",
  "-- You're mistaken, Madam, -- I said. -- I'm only his friend. My name is Watson.\n\nA blush covered her pretty face. She was visibly embarrassed.\n\n-- There's been a misunderstanding... -- she said.\n\n-- You haven't had much time for conversation, -- her brother interjected, piercing her with a scrutinizing gaze.\n\n-- I spoke to Doctor Watson as to a permanent resident of these parts, not a visitor. But perhaps you would care to visit us at Merripit House?\n\nI accepted the invitation. The road was short, leading along the edge of a meadow. The house, clearly converted from an old farmhouse, stood amongst small trees, surrounded by a stone wall; it looked sad and gloomy.\n\nAn old, grumpy servant opened the door for us. The dwelling was spacious, and a woman's hand was evident in its furnishing. Looking out the window at the bogs, strewn with stones, I wondered what could have induced such a well-educated man and such a beautiful woman to choose this place as their residence.\n\n-- You're probably surprised that we've pitched our tents here? -- Stapleton said, as if in response to my thoughts. -- And yet we are well and happy. Aren't we, Beryl?\n\n-- Quite happy, -- she confirmed, without enthusiasm.\n\n-- I had a school in one of the northern counties, -- Stapleton said -- but that kind of work didn't suit my temperament, although the interaction with children, shaping their minds, held much charm for me. Fate, however, pushed me onto a different path. An epidemic broke out. Three boys from my school fell victim to it; the school suffered as a result and could no longer sustain itself. This caused me a significant financial loss; but I only regret the deceased children; I don't regret it for myself, because I have time to devote to my favourite studies and I've found here a rich field for studies in botany and zoology. My sister shares my natural inclinations. I say this to help you solve the riddle you were pondering while looking at the moor.\n\n-- I was indeed surprised that you chose this area, where staying must be dreary, especially for the lady.\n\n-- I am comfortable here, -- she declared.\n\n-- We have books, we have our scientific pursuits, and besides, we have neighbours. Doctor Mortimer is a learned man in his field, poor Sir Charles was a pleasant companion. We saw him often, and his death was a blow to us. Do you think, without being intrusive, I could pay a visit to Sir Henry today?\n\n-- I'm sure he'll be glad to see you.\n\n-- Then I'll visit him this afternoon. I would like, as much as possible, to make his stay in these parts pleasant before he becomes accustomed to the gloomy surroundings. Would you care to see my butterfly collection? I think there isn't a more extensive one in all of southern England.\n\nI couldn't accept the invitation; I was already anxious to return to my companion. I was worried about him, I was involuntarily impressed by the sad landscape, and probably also by Miss Stapleton's warnings, spoken so seriously, almost solemnly, that they must have concealed some secret. Therefore, despite pressing invitations for breakfast, I bade farewell to the siblings and returned to the manor along the same path.\n\nThere must have been another, shorter route, because before I reached the road, to my great surprise, I saw Miss Stapleton sitting on a stone by the roadside.\n\n-- I ran ahead to meet you here, I didn't even take my hat, -- she said, breathless. I want to ask you to forget my words. They didn't concern you.\n\n-- I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton, -- I replied. -- I'm Sir Henry's friend, I'm concerned about his safety. Please explain to me why you advised him to leave these parts and return to London?\n\n-- It was a woman's whim, Doctor Watson. When you get to know me, you'll see that I can't always explain the motives behind my words and actions.\n\n-- No, no, I remember how your voice trembled, I remember how you looked at me with apprehension. For God's sake, be honest with me, Miss Stapleton. From the first moment I arrived in these parts, I feel something ominous in the air. We are walking as if on those green patches in the bog, any moment we may sink into them, and no one wants to show us where the danger lies. Tell me what your words meant, and in return I promise to repeat them to Sir Henry.\n\nHesitation was reflected on Miss Stapleton's face, but it was short-lived.\n\n-- You attach too much importance to my words, -- she replied.  My brother and I were very upset by Sir Charles's death. He often visited us, spoke with apprehension about the curse that weighed upon his family. No wonder that after his tragic death I was ready to believe in the validity of his fears, and seeing his heir, a representative of the same family, I considered it my duty to warn him of the possible danger. That was the sole purpose of my words.\n\n-- But what is the nature of this danger?\n\n-- Have you heard the legend of the hound?\n\n-- I don't believe in such nonsense.\n\n-- But I do. If you have influence over Sir Henry, take him away from this area. The world is wide. Why must Sir Henry necessarily live here, where danger threatens him?\n\n-- Precisely because it threatens him. Such is his nature. If you cannot give me a more important reason, I will not be able to persuade him to leave Baskerville Hall with that argument.\n\n-- I cannot give another reason, because I know of no other.\n\n-- One more question, Miss Stapleton. If there was no hidden meaning in your words, why didn't you want your brother to hear them?\n\n-- My brother wants the manor to be inhabited, because he believes that the presence of the owner is necessary for the good of the area. He would be angry with me if he knew that I was advising Sir Henry to leave these parts. I have fulfilled my duty and will add nothing more. I must go back, because my brother will guess that I have been talking to you. Goodbye!\n\nShe left, leaving me prey to fears and anxieties about Sir Henry.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nDoctor Watson's First Report.\n\n\nFrom this point, I will transcribe my own letters to Sherlock Holmes, for they record those events, thoughts, and suspicions with greater accuracy than my memory.\n\n\n                            _Baskerville Hall, October 13th._\n\nMy dear Holmes! My previous letters and telegrams have informed you thoroughly and in detail of everything that has happened in this gloomy corner.\n\nThe longer I stay here, the more sad and troubled I feel. These bogs cast a shadow on the soul. It seems to me that I have moved not only to another country, but also to another era, that I live in prehistoric times.\n\nThe stone dwellings of our ancestors densely populate the moor, and one wonders why they settled in these bogs? I assume it was a cowardly tribe, shunning warlike neighbours, and the bog was the safest fortress against them.\n\nThese hypotheses, however, have nothing to do with my mission and will not interest your practical mind. I know how indifferent it is to you whether the earth revolves around the sun or vice versa. I return to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.\n\nIf you haven't received reports for the last few days, it's only because there was nothing to write about until today. An unusual event occurred today, but before I tell you about it, I must acquaint you with other aspects of the situation.\n\nI have already mentioned the escaped convict who is hiding among the bogs. In all probability, he has already left these parts, which is desirable for the inhabitants living in the wilderness.\n\nTwo weeks have passed since his escape, and so far no one has seen him or heard of him. It is easy to hide in this bog, strewn with stones that served as shelter for prehistoric man, but there is no food there; we therefore assume that he has escaped, and the local farmers are beginning to regain courage.\n\nThere are four strong men in the manor; we could defend ourselves if necessary; but I admit that I was worried about the Stapletons. They live in complete isolation, a few miles from human settlements, keeping only a servant and a cook. The brother is frail and not very strong, the sister, although tall and well-built, could not resist such a robber. If he attacked them, they would be at his mercy. Sir Henry is worried about them; he gave them Perkins, the groom, just in case, but Stapleton firmly refused.\n\nOur baronet is beginning to take a keen interest in his beautiful neighbour. It is no wonder that in such a monotonous life he seeks entertainment, and it is even less surprising that the young lady is so lovely. There is something fiery, subtropical about her; the contrast between her and her cold, unattractive brother is astonishing. Although he too gives the impression of a volcano covered with ashes. He evidently has a great influence on his sister; I noticed that Miss Beryl, when speaking, constantly looks at him, as if seeking approval. He has a dangerous gleam in his eyes, and his tight lips betray a hard and unrelenting nature. He would be an interesting study for you.\n\nHe paid a visit to Baskerville the day after our arrival, and the very next morning he took us to the place famous for the legend of the cruel Hugo. It is a long, several-mile trip across the meadow and the bogs, and the place itself is so gloomy that it could inspire a bloody legend. Two huge, pointed stones stand there; Sir Henry was moved and repeatedly asked Stapleton if he really believed in the influence of supernatural forces on the course of our lives.\n\nHe asked cheerfully, but it was evident that he took the matter seriously. Stapleton was cautious in his answers, but it could be seen that he refrained from expressing his thoughts for the sake of the baronet's peace of mind. He told us several incidents in which ancient families were persecuted by some unclean force and left us with the impression that he believed in that legend.\n\nReturning from this excursion, he invited us to breakfast at Merripit House, and then Sir Henry met Miss Stapleton. From the first moment she made a great impression on him, and if I'm not mistaken, it was mutual. From that day on, the baronet visits there every day. Today he invited the siblings to dinner. One might think that such a marriage should be welcome by Stapleton, yet I perceive dissatisfaction on his face whenever Sir Henry approaches his sister or shows his admiration. I explain this to myself by selfish attachment, because the life of a naturalist in this wilderness would be even sadder if it were not brightened by Miss Beryl. I doubt whether Stapleton will take his egoism so far as to oppose this brilliant marriage, although he clearly does not want intimacy between his sister and the baronet; several times he interrupted their private conversations.\n\nBe that as it may, it will be difficult for me now to fulfill your order: that I should never leave Sir Henry. I would soon bore him if I followed him like a shadow.\n\nThe other day, on Thursday, Doctor Mortimer was with us for breakfast. At the excavations in Long-Dawn, he managed to find the skull of a prehistoric man. He is overjoyed. It is difficult to find a greater enthusiast and maniac.\n\nAfter breakfast, the Stapletons arrived. At Sir Henry's request, the doctor took us all to the Avenue of Elms to show us how things were on that night.\n\nThe avenue is long, with wide hedges on both sides, and lawns behind them. At the end of the avenue stands a summer house, a kind of gazebo. In the middle of the road is a gate leading to the meadow, beyond which lies the bog. The gate is wooden, white, has a handle and a latch. I remembered your hypothesis and tried to reconstruct the catastrophe in my mind.\n\nStanding at this gate, poor Sir Charles saw something that frightened him so much that he lost consciousness and started running straight ahead until he ran out of breath and fell dead from exhaustion and terror. He fled through a leafy tunnel. What frightened him? An ordinary sheepdog, or some fantastic, ghostly creature? Was there a human hand in it, or a supernatural force? Perhaps pale Barrymore knows much more about this event than he says? Whatever the solution to the riddle, its last word is—murder.\n\nI also met another neighbour, Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall. He lives four miles from us. He is an elderly man, grey-haired, choleric, a notorious litigant; he lost half his fortune on lawsuits. He is not interested in the subject of the dispute, but in the process itself. Sometimes he closes the public road and forces the commune to sue him in court. Another time he intrudes on a private road, proving that it once served a public purpose. He knows all customary law, sometimes uses his knowledge to the benefit of the peasants of Fernworthy, and sometimes against them; he is sometimes carried in triumph through the village, or burned in effigy, according to his activities.\n\nHe currently has seven lawsuits, which will probably consume the rest of his fortune.\n\nApart from this mania, he seems to be a good-natured, kind old man; I mention him only because you instructed me to describe to you all the people I meet and hear about.\n\nCurrently, Mr. Frankland has a new pastime: through an excellent telescope, he spends his days from the roof of his house looking for the escaped convict. If only he would stop there! but he allegedly wants to sue Doctor Mortimer for opening the prehistoric grave without the permission of the descendants, and that is because... of a Neolithic skull unearthed in Long-Dawn. In any case, it diversifies our monotonous life and introduces a bit of a comical element into it.\n\nAnd now, having informed you about the escaped convict, having described the Stapleton siblings, Doctor Mortimer and Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall, I will tell you something very interesting about Barrymore and the unusual events of last night.\n\nFirst, a word about the telegram you sent from London, which was to serve as proof of Barrymore's presence in the manor.\n\nI have already informed you that, judging by the words of the postmaster, I have come to the conclusion that this attempt proved nothing. I spoke about this to Sir Henry, and he, with his usual frankness, summoned Barrymore and asked him if he had received a telegram. Barrymore replied affirmatively.\n\n-- Did the boy deliver it to your hands? -- Sir Henry asked.\n\nBarrymore looked surprised.\n\n-- No, -- he replied after a moment's thought -- I was in the attic then, but my wife brought me the telegram immediately.\n\n-- Did you reply to it yourself?\n\n-- I asked my wife to do it for me.\n\nAfter dinner he brought up the matter again on his own initiative.\n\n-- I didn't understand why you asked me about that telegram, sir, -- he said. -- Did I do something wrong?\n\nSir Henry reassured him in this regard and offered him part of his wardrobe, as the suits ordered in London had already arrived.\n\nMrs. Barrymore intrigues me. She is a fat, sluggish, serious woman, she looks like a puritan. It's hard to imagine a less sensitive person, and yet I have already told you that I clearly heard her crying on the first night of our stay at Baskerville Hall; then I saw traces of tears on her face several times. She must have some great sorrow. Sometimes I wonder if she is tormented by pangs of conscience, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a tyrant.\n\nI immediately noticed something unusual about him; but what I saw last night confirms my worst suspicions.\n\nAnd yet the fact itself may seem trivial.\n\nYou know that I am a light sleeper, and since I arrived here as a guardian angel, I sleep with my eyes open, like a hare.\n\nSo, last night, around two o'clock, I was awakened by the sound of footsteps passing by my room. I got up, opened the door and looked out. A long shadow was gliding down the corridor, cast by a man sneaking on tiptoe with a candle in his hand. He was in his shirt and trousers, barefoot, walking slowly and very cautiously, there was something mysterious in his whole demeanor.\n\nThe corridor is intersected by a balcony located above the main hall and porch, but it runs further on the other side of it. When I stood by the balcony, the shadow had already reached the other end of the corridor; from the glow of the light I realised that he had entered one of the adjoining rooms.\n\nSince all these rooms are unfurnished, the purpose of the journey became even more enigmatic. The light shone constantly in one point. I looked into that room through the slightly ajar door.\n\nBarrymore stood by the window and held the candle close to the pane. He was turned in profile to me; I saw expectation and anxiety on his face. For a moment he stood motionless, then he muttered something, waved his hand and put the candle down.\n\nI ran back to my room. Soon I heard the quiet footsteps again. Barrymore was returning.\n\nFor a long time I couldn't calm down, thousands of thoughts and suspicions flashed through my head. Already half-asleep, I heard the creak of a key in the door, but I couldn't tell which one.\n\nWhat it all means – I don't know, but in any case, strange things are happening in this house, boding no good. Sooner or later, we will unravel the mystery. I don't want to mislead you with my assumptions, because you only demand facts.\n\nI had a long conversation with Sir Henry this morning and we devised a plan of action. You will find it in my next letter.\n\n\nIX.\n\n(Doctor Watson's Second Report).\n\nLight on the Moor.\n\n\n                                 _Baskerville Hall, October 15th._\n\n\nMy dear Holmes!\n\nI have left you without news for a long time, but today I want to compensate you.\n\nThe facts followed each other so quickly that it was difficult to write them down. I informed you that I saw Barrymore sneaking around at night with a light in his hand to an empty room. Now I have a whole bouquet of news. Things have taken an unexpected turn, in the last two days more than one mystery has been revealed, and others have become even more obscure. Judge for yourself.\n\nThe next morning, before breakfast, I went to the empty room visited by Barrymore the previous night. The window through which he passed faced west and was distinguished from the others by the closest view of the moor. There is an empty space between two trees through which one can see the meadow and the moor up close, while from other windows the view is further away and obscured.\n\nWas Barrymore watching someone or something on the moor? The night was so dark that it was impossible to see anything with the best eyesight. So what was the purpose of these observations?\n\nAt first I thought it was a love intrigue. That's why he was sneaking around barefoot, that's why he was restless. Barrymore is an unusually handsome man and may have success with women – this hypothesis seemed plausible to me. The creak of the key in the lock may have indicated a secret exit for a rendezvous.\n\nSuch were my conclusions; I tell you about them, although the result showed their groundlessness.\n\nJudging that I have no right to keep them to myself, I confided in Sir Henry, having first told him what I had seen. He was less surprised than I could have imagined.\n\n-- I know Barrymore walks at night, -- he declared. -- Several times I have heard his footsteps in the corridor at the same time.\n\n-- So he might go to the window every night?\n\n-- Maybe. In that case, we'll catch him red-handed and find out the purpose of his wanderings. I'm also curious how Holmes would act in our place?\n\n-- I think he would do the same thing you intend to do, -- I replied. -- I'm only afraid that Barrymore will hear our steps.\n\n-- He has a dull hearing; I've noticed that several times. So tonight we'll lie in wait in my room.\n\nSir Henry was clearly pleased; this new expedition was a diversification of his boring life.\n\nThere was feverish activity in the manor. The baronet had brought an architect from London, and carpenters and decorators from Plymouth; he spared no expense to restore the former glory to his ancestors' seat.\n\nOnce the manor is furnished, the only thing missing will be – a beautiful lady of the house.\n\nBetween you and me, I can easily guess who might take that place. The baronet is head over heels in love with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton.\n\nBut there are obstacles in the path of this love. Not far from today, Sir Henry had an unpleasant surprise.\n",
  "After our conversation about Barrymore, he took his hat and left. I followed him.\n\n\"-- Are you following me, Watson?\" -- he asked with visible displeasure.\n\n\"-- It depends on where you're going; if it's to the moor and the bog, I'll go with you.\"\n\n\"-- That's exactly where I'm heading.\"\n\n\"-- You know what Holmes instructed me to do... I'm sorry to impose myself on you, sir, but I can't leave you alone in the marshes.\"\n\nSir Henry laid a hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"-- My dear fellow,\" he said with a smile, \"-- Sherlock Holmes, despite his perspicacity, didn't foresee what has transpired since I've taken up residence by the bog. You understand me?... And I'm sure you won't want to interfere with me at such a moment.\"\n\nI was in a difficult position, and as I stood there preoccupied, my companion turned and walked across the moor.\n\nI reproached myself for leaving him to his own fate. What if misfortune should befall him!...\n\nAt the very thought, my blood rushed to my head.\n\nPerhaps it wasn't too late, perhaps I could still catch up with him...\n\nI followed in the direction Sir Henry had gone, but I couldn't see him until he finally appeared around a bend in the road, where the path leading through the bog branched off from the highway.\n\nI turned aside, and instead of following him, I climbed a small hill from which the whole plain was visible. Hiding behind a rock, I followed his movements.\n\nHe had gone along the path for a good half-mile when suddenly I saw Miss Stapleton approaching him.\n\nSo it was a prearranged meeting...\n\nAfter greeting each other, they walked on, very slowly; from the movement of their hands I judged that Miss Beryl was asking him for something.\n\nI pondered what to do. It's despicable to spy on a friend; under the circumstances, it was my duty; but if he were in danger, I was too far away to offer help. So what was I to do? I hesitated between a sense of delicacy and duty.\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Henry and his companion stopped on the path. They were talking very animatedly. Suddenly I noticed that I wasn't the only witness to their meeting. I saw something green hanging in the air. On closer inspection, I saw that it was a butterfly net.\n\nStapleton was walking. He was much closer to the young couple than I was and was clearly heading towards them.\n\nThen Sir Henry embraced Miss Stapleton; it seemed to me that she was resisting his embrace. He leaned over her, wanting to kiss her -- she shielded herself with her hand.\n\nSuddenly they sprang apart. Stapleton startled them. He rushed towards them, waving his arms, and when he reached them -- he stamped his feet and undoubtedly shouted and remonstrated with Sir Henry. The latter was visibly justifying himself.\n\nFinally, Stapleton beckoned to his sister, who after a moment's hesitation went with him, casting a look at the baronet.\n\nHe stood for a long time, rooted to the spot, then walked away slowly, his head bowed.\n\nWhat did it all mean? I couldn't understand, but I was agitated by the sight of this scene. I ran down the hill and met Sir Henry.\n\n\"-- Watson!\" he exclaimed. \"-- Where did you come from? Were you following me against my will?\"\n\nI confessed the truth. At first his eyes flashed with anger, but my honesty evidently disarmed him; in the end -- he laughed.\n\n\"-- One might think that such a wasteland favors solitude, and yet,\" he said jokingly, \"-- it's impossible to compete without witnesses... It's a sad competition, though. Where were you hiding?\"\n\n\"-- Behind those rocks, on the hill.\"\n\n\"-- Did you see which way her brother came from?\"\n\n\"-- The opposite.\"\n\n\"-- Does he strike you as a madman?\"\n\n\"-- No.\"\n\n\"-- From the first moment he seemed abnormal to me, and now I'm ready to admit that either I, or he, is missing a screw. Listen, Watson: you've been living with me for a few weeks, tell me frankly, haven't you noticed any mental deviation in me? How do you find me: could I be a good husband for a beloved woman?\"\n\n\"-- I think you would be the best.\"\n\n\"-- He can't fault my social standing. So what does he have against me personally? I haven't harmed anyone, I've lived honestly. And yet he doesn't allow me to touch even the tip of her finger.\"\n\n\"-- Did he actually forbid it?\"\n\n\"-- Yes, and he said many other unpleasant things to me. I tell you, Watson, although I've known her for a few weeks, I feel that I wouldn't be as happy with any other woman as with her; and it seems to me that she reciprocates my feelings. There are flashes in a woman's eyes that are more eloquent than words. But that unbearable brother doesn't allow us to communicate. Today, for the first time, I had the opportunity to see her alone. She seemed pleased, although she didn't want to listen to my declarations of love. She kept returning to one subject, warning me of the impending danger and proving that she wouldn't have peace until I left these parts. I told her that I wasn't in a hurry to leave, since she was here, and that if she truly cared for my safety, she would leave this area with me, and I asked for her hand. But before she could answer me, her tormented brother burst between us, like a bullet. He was pale with rage, trembling, and lightning flashed from his bright eyes.\n\nHow dare I speak to his sister in this way? -- he shouted. -- Does the fact that I am a baronet give me the right to do all this?...\n\nI explained to him that I didn't need to be ashamed of my feelings for Miss Beryl and that I hoped she would honor me with her hand.\n\nIt didn't improve things. Stapleton became thoroughly enraged. And I lost my patience. I replied to him, too sharply considering her presence.\n\nIt ended with him leaving with his sister, and I'm returning, crestfallen. Explain this to me, and I will be grateful to you until death.\"\n\nI offered several explanations, but they didn't satisfy Sir Henry, because indeed, what could be held against him?\n\nHis title, fortune, character, age, and appearance all speak in his favor. The only charge that could be made against him is that fatalism pursues his family. But Stapleton, as a learned man, shouldn't attach importance to superstitions.\n\nSo I don't understand why he rejects his advances without even asking if his sister is favorably disposed towards him, and I'm also surprised that she obeys him blindly.\n\nOur speculations on this subject were interrupted by Stapleton himself, who arrived in the afternoon to apologize to the baronet for his impulsiveness.\n\nAfter a long conversation alone with Sir Henry in his study, they emerged reconciled. To seal their agreement, he invited us to dinner at Merripit House.\n\n\"-- He's a strange man,\" Sir Henry said to me after his departure. \"-- I can't forget the look with which he struck me this morning, but nevertheless I must admit that he behaved decently now.\"\n\n\"-- Did he explain his behavior?\"\n\n\"-- He said that his sister is everything to him in the world. They always lived together, she was his only companion. The mere thought of losing her drives him to despair. He didn't notice my inclination towards Beryl, and when he saw her in my arms, he was overcome by such selfish anger that he lost his composure and is not responsible for his words and deeds. However, he apologized and admitted that it would be madness to want to keep a woman as beautiful as his sister. If she is to leave him, Stapleton prefers that she marry a neighbor living so close, rather than anyone else. But he must come to terms with that thought. He is ready to give me her hand if, in return, I pledge my word of honor that for three months I will not mention love to her, will not try to see her alone, and will be content with an ordinary social relationship. I solemnly promised him this, and that's where things stand.\"\n\nSo one of the mysteries has been solved. We have felt solid ground under our feet in the bog, through which we have been groping blindly.\n\nWe now know why Stapleton looked unkindly upon his sister's rival; although this rival is one of the best matches in the country.\n\nAnd now I turn to another thread that I have pulled from the tangled skein -- to the cause of Mrs. Barrymore's tears and her husband's mysterious nocturnal wanderings.\n\nCongratulate me, Holmes, and admit that I haven't failed your trust. This riddle was solved in one night.\n\nI wrote: \"in one night,\" but in reality it happened over the course of two nights, because the first attempts failed.\n\nI sat with Sir Henry in his room until three in the morning, but no other sound reached us except the ticking of the clock. Finally, we both fell asleep in our chairs.\n\nUndeterred, we decided to try again. The following night we extinguished the lamp, and lighting our cigarettes, we waited to see what would happen next.\n\nThe hours crawled by slowly. One o'clock struck, two o'clock; sleep was already overcoming us, when suddenly we both straightened up in our chairs. We heard the sound of footsteps.\n\nThey crept quietly and finally stopped in the distance. Then the baronet opened the door and we went out on tiptoe.\n\nBarrymore had already passed the gallery, the corridor was plunged into darkness.\n\nWe tiptoed to the other wing just as the valet was slipping into the room at the end of the corridor. He closed the door behind him. We crept up quietly, treading carefully, fearing that the creaking of the floor might betray us. We peered through the keyhole. Barrymore stood by the window with a candle in his hand.\n\nWe hadn't planned our campaign, but the baronet considers a straight path the shortest and most appropriate. Without hesitation, he entered the room. Barrymore jumped back from the window.\n\n\"-- What are you doing here?\" Sir Henry asked him.\n\n\"-- Nothing, sir.\"\n\nHe was so frightened that the candle was jumping in his hand.\n\n\"-- I came to see if the window was closed... I close all the windows every day, so that a thief doesn't sneak in.\"\n\n\"-- Yes, especially here, on the... second floor. Listen, Barrymore,\" he said, \"-- we both decided to force you to tell the truth. The sooner you confess, the better for you. Enough of these lies. Speak! What were you doing here?\"\n\nHe looked at us with despair, wringing his hands helplessly.\n\n\"-- I didn't do anything wrong,\" he whispered. \"-- I was holding a candle at the window.\"\n\n\"-- And why were you holding it?\"\n\n\"-- Don't ask me that. I give you my word of honor that it's someone else's secret. I can't reveal it. If it were only about me, I would tell you the whole truth.\"\n\nA sudden thought flashed through my mind. I took the candle that Barrymore had placed on the window.\n\n\"-- It's probably a prearranged signal,\" I said. \"-- Let's see what the answer will be.\"\n\nI raised the candle and held it as he had before our entry. Despite the darkness, because the moon was obscured by clouds, the trees were visible, and beyond them the moor. Then I saw a faint light on the bog.\n\n\"-- There's a signal!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"-- No, sir, that means nothing,\" Barrymore interrupted me. \"-- I assure you that it's accidental.\"\n\n\"-- Move the candle, Watson,\" the baronet exclaimed. \"-- Do you see? And that light is moving... Will you still deny, you scoundrel, that you were giving each other signals?... Come here. Tell me, who is your accomplice and what conspiracy are you plotting?\"\n\nThe valet's face darkened with suppressed anger.\n\n\"-- I won't tell!\" he declared haughtily. \"-- It's my business, not yours.\"\n\n\"-- Then get out of my house immediately!\"\n\n\"-- Very well. If necessary, so be it.\"\n\n\"-- And don't you dare show your face to me again! It's a shame, a disgrace!... Your family has served mine for several generations, and you're plotting conspiracies against me?... \"\n\n\"-- No, not against you.\"\n\nThese words were spoken in a woman's voice. Mrs. Barrymore stood in the doorway, even paler than her husband.\n\n\"-- We're leaving here, Eliza,\" the valet announced to her. \"-- Pack our things.\"\n\n\"-- Oh, John! John! I've ruined you!... It's all my fault, Sir Henry, entirely mine... He's not to blame. He did it for me, because I asked him to.\"\n\n\"-- Speak, Madam, explain what this means?\" Sir Henry exclaimed.\n\n\"-- My unfortunate brother is starving to death, out there, on the moor... We can't abandon him... This light is a signal that we have prepared food for him... and that light indicates where we are to bring it...\"\n\n\"-- So your brother is...\"\n\n\"-- A fugitive convict... a murderer... Seldon.\"\n\n\"-- It's true,\" Barrymore affirmed. \"-- I said that the secret wasn't mine and that I had no right to betray it. But now Sir Henry is convinced that it wasn't a conspiracy against him...\"\n\nSuch, then, is the explanation of the nocturnal wanderings and the light in the window.\n\nSir Henry and I looked at this woman with amazement. Could it be possible that such a decent and respectable person had the same blood in her veins as the notorious criminal?...\n\n\"-- Yes, sir,\" she said as if in answer to our thoughts. \"-- My maiden name was Seldon, and that's my younger brother... We spoiled him in his childhood, he was allowed everything, so he became convinced that the world existed for his pleasure... When he grew up, he fell into bad company, he began to carouse and even worse... He drove our poor mother to the grave, and he besmirched our name with mud. He fell lower and lower, finally committing that last crime... But to me, he is always the little boy with bright curls, whom I looked after as an older sister. That's why he escaped from prison. He knew that I was here and that I wouldn't refuse to help him... He crawled to us, exhausted, starving, hunted by the police. What was I to do?... We took him in, locked him in the attic, fed him, clothed him. After your arrival, sir, my brother thought he would be safer on the moor, and he hid there. Day by day we expected him to leave these parts, but as long as he is here, we cannot abandon him. If anyone is to blame, it is I, not my husband; he hid and fed him for my sake...\"\n\nThere was sincerity in her voice.\n\n\"-- Is that true, Barrymore?... \" Sir Henry asked.\n\n\"-- Yes, sir, the holy truth.\"\n\n\"-- Ha! I can't blame you for yielding to your wife's pleas. Both of you return to your room. We'll talk about this tomorrow.\"\n\nWe looked out the window again. Sir Henry opened it; a cool breeze struck our faces. Far away on the moor, a faint light was burning.\n\n\"-- It's strange that he's not afraid to betray his presence...\" said the baronet.\n\n\"-- Perhaps he placed the light so that it's only visible from this point.\"\n\n\"-- What do you think: how far is it from here?\"\n\n\"-- A mile and a half, two at most. As far as I can judge, it's near Cleft Tor.\"\n\n\"-- It doesn't have to be far if Barrymore carries food there every day. Listen, Watson, I'll catch that scoundrel!\"\n\nAnd the same thought went through my head. After all, Barrymore hadn't revealed the secret voluntarily, but under pressure; we weren't therefore bound by secrecy, especially since it concerned a scoundrel towards whom all considerations of compassion ceased. Our duty was to deliver him into the hands of justice, to prevent him from committing further crimes. If we spared him, our neighbors, the Stapletons for example, might pay for it with their lives.\n\nAnxiety for them undoubtedly influenced Sir Henry's decision.\n\n\"-- I'll go with you,\" I declared.\n\n\"-- Then take a revolver and put on your shoes\" (we were both barefoot to tread more quietly). \"-- The sooner we set out, the better. The scoundrel may extinguish the light at any moment and we won't find him at night.\"\n\nIn five minutes we were ready and set out on this dangerous expedition.\n\nThe night was cloudy, damp, from time to time the moon emerged from behind the clouds, and when we reached the bog, a light drizzle began.\n\nThe light was still burning.\n\n\"-- Do you have a revolver?\" I asked.\n\n\"-- I have a hunting knife,\" replied Sir Henry.\n\n\"-- We must surprise him, because they say he's as strong as a lion. We'll overpower him before he can resist us.\"\n\n\"-- I wonder what Holmes would say about our expedition,\" said the baronet. \"-- This is the hour of ghosts; they roam the moor now...\" he added half-jokingly.\n\nAs if in response to these words, that terrifying sound, which I had already heard once near Grimpen Mire, resounded across the marsh. The wind carried it through the night's silence; at first it was a low growl, soon it turned into a terrible howl. The baronet turned pale and grabbed my sleeve.\n\n\"-- For God's sake, what is that, Watson?\" he asked in a whisper.\n\n\"-- I don't know. They say that sound is often heard on the moor,\" I replied. \"-- I've heard it once before.\"\n\nA terrifying, ominous silence fell again. We stood listening, but no sound reached our ears.\n\n\"-- Watson...\" the baronet whispered, \"-- it was a dog barking!... \"\n\nHis voice contained suppressed fear.\n\n\"-- How do the local residents explain this terrifying howl?\" he asked.\n\n\"-- Who would pay attention to what simple folk say.\"\n\n\"-- Tell me, though, what they say?\"\n\nI hesitated.\n\n\"-- They say it's the barking of the Baskerville hounds,\" I replied.\n\nHe was silent for a long time.\n\n\"-- Yes, it was a dog,\" he finally said. \"-- It barked very far away, in the direction of Grimpen Mire...\"\n\n\"-- It's difficult to determine where the sound came from.\"\n\n\"-- I tell you, from there, Watson. And what do you think? Was it barking?... I'm not a child. You can tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"-- I heard that sound for the first time while walking with Stapleton. He explained to me that it was the call of a rare bird.\"\n\n\"-- No, no, it was a dog. Could it be that the legend is based on real facts? Could I really be in danger?... What do you think, Watson?\"\n\n\"-- I'm sure you're not.\"\n\n\"-- Hmm! It's one thing to laugh at these fables in London, and quite another to stand here, in the darkness on the moor, and hear that terrifying sound. My poor uncle! After all, the tracks of a large dog were clearly seen near his corpse... It all fits together. I'm not a coward, Watson, but that barking chilled my blood. Touch my hand.\"\n\nIt was cold as marble.\n\n\"-- You'll be laughing about this adventure tomorrow,\" I said to reassure him.\n\n\"-- I doubt it; that sound will remain in my memory forever. What do you advise me to do?\"\n\n\"-- To go home.\"\n\n\"-- No. We came here to catch the murderer and we won't turn back halfway. Let's go! Let what will be, be.\"\n\nWe walked slowly through the darkness. The light was still burning in one spot. At times it seemed to us that it was near, then again that it was very far away. Finally, we figured out in which direction it was shining.\n\nNot far from us, in a crevice between two rocks, sheltering it from the wind, stood a candle in a lantern. It wasn't visible from any other point, only from the side of Baskerville Hall. The rocky outcrop shielded us from the fugitive's eyes. Crawling carefully, we crawled up to the candle.\n\n\"-- Now what?\" Sir Henry whispered.\n\n\"-- Let's wait. He must be nearby. We must look. Perhaps we'll see him.\"\n\nAs soon as I had finished saying these words, a monstrous, animalistic face, furrowed with wild passions, yellow as wax, appeared in the rock crevice above the candle. The criminal was bearded up to his eyes. That's how our ancestors, inhabiting these bogs in the prehistoric era, probably looked.\n\nThe murderer was looking around anxiously, like an animal when it hears the sound of the hunt.\n\nSomething evidently aroused his suspicion. Perhaps Barrymore used to give him a signal that we didn't know about, or perhaps the villain had another reason for fear, but fear was painted on his wild face.\n\nAt any moment he could retreat and disappear into the darkness.\nI jumped out of my hiding place, Sir Henry behind me. The criminal cursed terribly and threw a huge stone. It smashed against the rock against which we had been leaning a moment before. By a fortunate coincidence, the moon had just broken through the clouds and illuminated the bog.\n\nWe ran down the hill, chasing the fleeing Seldon. He was jumping from stone to stone, from rock to rock, like a wild goat.\n\nI could have knocked the criminal down immediately with a shot from my revolver, but I had taken it for defense in case of attack, not for killing a defenseless man.\n\nBoth Sir Henry and I run remarkably well; however, we soon realized that we wouldn't be able to catch him. In the moonlight we saw his broad shoulders and bow legs for a long time, until finally he appeared to us as a small dot on the horizon.\n",
  "We ran until we were completely breathless, but the distance between us and the fleeing Seldon constantly increased. Finally, out of breath, we sat down on a rock, watching him until he disappeared from sight.\n\nIt was at this very moment that a strange and unexpected thing happened. After resting, we were getting up to return home, having abandoned further pursuit. The full moon was setting behind one of the taller rocks; then, on its summit, I saw a male figure, looking like a statue.\n\nDon't think it was a delusion. As far as I could tell, it was a tall, slender man. He stood with his arms crossed, his head bowed, as if gazing into that empty space.\n\nIt might be a bog ghost... Whatever it was, it wasn't Seldon, as he had just disappeared in the opposite direction. Besides, that figure was much taller and more slender.\n\nI wanted to show this phenomenon to the baronet, but the moment I turned around, the figure had vanished. Against the backdrop of the moon's disc, the rocks stood out sharply, but the living statue was no longer on their summit.\n\nI wanted to go and see what it was, but the baronet wasn't keen on seeking new thrills. He hadn't noticed the strange phenomenon and insisted that I had imagined it, because he hadn't felt the sensation that had shaken me to the core.\n\n-- It's probably some kind of earth guardian. The bog has been swarming with them ever since Seldon escaped from prison.\n\nHa! Who knows if such an explanation isn't true; however, I would like to confirm it.\n\nToday we intend to report to the prison authorities in Princetown, where they are to search for the fugitive. It's a shame, though, that we didn't manage to catch him ourselves.\n\nSuch are the adventures of last night. You must admit, Holmes, that my report is very detailed and accurate. Many facts remain to be explained; I present them to you without comment, so as not to interfere with your deductions.\n\nWe have moved forward on the path of discovery. We now know the reason for the Barrymores' nocturnal wanderings – and this simplifies the situation.\n\nBut the moor still holds many unexplained secrets. Perhaps in my next letter I will be able to shed some light on them. It would be best if you could come yourself.\n\n\nX.\n\nExtract from Dr. Watson's diary.\n\n\nUp to this point in my story, I have relied on letters written to Sherlock Holmes. From now on, to refresh my memory, I must consult my diary from that time. I will quote a few passages, starting from the day following our pursuit.\n\n\nOctober 16th.\n\n\nA fine drizzle is falling incessantly. The whole house is shrouded in a thick fog; it rises and falls, revealing the meadow and the moor. There is sadness in the mansion and the courtyard.\n\nThe baronet is experiencing a reaction after yesterday's excitement. I myself feel a strange unease, I almost see the approaching danger, and it is all the more threatening because we cannot define it.\n\nThere is no lack of reasons for concern. A whole series of circumstances has contributed to arousing superstitious fear in us: first, the mysterious death of the previous owner of this residence; further – rumours circulating in the area, and finally those enigmatic sounds on the moor. I heard them twice with my own ears...\n\nAll this goes beyond the ordinary order of things and the laws of nature: the legendary spectral hound leaves footprints and howls terrifyingly. Stapleton even believes in its existence, and Doctor Mortimer, despite his knowledge, is convinced that he saw some supernatural creature.\n\nI, although not a scholar like those two gentlemen, cannot believe it; it would be to descend to the intellectual level of the local peasants, who are ready to swear that they saw a dog breathing fire and brimstone.\n\nHolmes wouldn't even listen to such tales – and I should be deaf to them.\n\nBut facts are facts, and I heard barking on the moor twice with my own ears. Let's assume there's some feral dog there – that would explain all these riddles.\n\nBut where does such a dog hide? Where does it find food? Why does nobody see it during the day?...\n\nIgnoring supernatural factors in this matter, there remains human activity: that pale man following us from the carriage, and the warning sent to Sir Henry. These are real facts, but that stranger could be both friend and foe. Where is he now? Did he remain in London? Or is he following us here? Perhaps he was the tall, slender man I saw in the moonlight on the top of the rock?\n\nIt is true, I saw him very indistinctly and fleetingly, but I am certain that it is no one from the area, because I already know all the neighbours. He was taller than Stapleton, more slender than Frankland. It could be Barrymore; but we left him at home, and he certainly didn't follow us.\n\nSo some stranger is following us – probably the same one as in London. If I could catch him, it might explain all these mysteries. I will exert all my energy to achieve this goal.\n\nAt first, I wanted to confide in Sir Henry about my plans, but after consideration I abandoned this intention. The baronet is upset – I don't want to increase his anxiety. I will act on my own.\n\nThis afternoon we had a small incident. Barrymore asked Sir Henry to listen. They talked behind closed doors in the study. Sitting in the billiard room, I heard snatches of conversation and guessed what it was about. After a while, the baronet opened the door and called me.\n\n-- Barrymore has a grievance against us, -- he said. -- He finds that we acted wrongly towards him, pursuing Seldon, since he, of his own free will, entrusted us with the secret.\n\nThe butler stood before us, paler than usual, and it was evident that he was restraining himself with difficulty.\n\n-- I may have expressed myself too sharply, -- he said, apologizing. -- I apologize, sir. But it's true, I was surprised that you gentlemen wanted to catch Seldon. That wretch has already had enough trouble with the police and certainly doesn't expect to be pursued by gentlemen...\n\n-- If you had confided in us of your own free will, it would have been different, -- the baronet explained to him – but you told us, or rather your wife told us the truth under pressure, so we have a free hand.\n\n-- I didn't think you'd take advantage of that...\n\n-- This man is harmful to the whole area. There are many secluded houses on the meadow and the moor, for example, Mr. Stapleton's villa: it stands on the outskirts. In case of an attack, who will come to help?... As long as this villain is roaming here, nobody is safe.\n\n-- He won't attack any house. I give you my word of honour for that. Besides, he will leave these parts in a few days. We have already made preparations to send him to South America. For God's sake, I beg you gentlemen, don't hand him over to the police!\n\n-- What do you say to that, Watson? -- Sir Henry asked me.\n\nI shrugged my shoulders.\n\n-- If he really is going to leave England, it will free the country from supporting one more villain, -- I replied.\n\n-- But can we be sure that he won't harm anyone before leaving?\n\n-- Sir, it would be madness on his part. We have provided him with everything he needs. A new crime would only put the police on his trail.\n\n-- That's true, -- Sir Henry admitted – so Barrymore...\n\n-- May God reward you, sir, -- the butler interrupted, with a sincere outburst of gratitude. -- My wife wouldn't survive a second such disgrace...\n\n-- We are simply helping and assisting a villain... But I don't want to drive Mrs. Barrymore to the grave... and if Seldon leaves these parts and behaves quietly, I will remain silent.\n\nThe butler bowed deeply and moved towards the door, but hesitated and approached Sir Henry again.\n\n-- You have been so kind to me, sir, -- he whispered – that I would like to repay you as much as I can. I know something and I should have said it earlier, but I discovered it after the investigation was finished. It concerns the death of Sir Charles...\n\nBoth Sir Henry and I jumped to our feet.\n\n-- You know how he died?... -- the baronet asked.\n\n-- No, sir, I don't know that.\n\n-- So what?\n\n-- I know why he was at the gate at that hour. He was waiting for a woman.\n\n-- A woman? He?...\n\n-- Yes, sir.\n\n-- What is her name?\n\n-- I don't know the name, I can only mention the initials.\n\n-- How do you know them, Barrymore?\n\n-- Sir Charles received a letter that morning. He usually received many letters, because his kind heart was known, and everyone in trouble turned to him. But then there was only this one letter, so I noticed it. It bore the Coombe-Tracey postmark, the address was written in a woman's hand.\n\n-- And so what?\n\n-- I had already forgotten about this detail, when a few weeks ago, my wife, tidying up in Sir Charles' study – (it remained untouched since his death) – well, my wife found in the ashes of the fireplace an unburnt fragment of a letter; it bore the words: \"I beg and implore you to burn this letter and come to the gate at ten o'clock.\" Below were the letters _L. L._\n\n-- Do you have this unburnt piece?\n\n-- No; when we touched it, it crumbled.\n\n-- Did Sir Charles receive previous letters written in the same hand?\n\n-- I didn't go through his correspondence, and I wouldn't have noticed this letter if it had arrived by post with others.\n\n-- You don't know who this _L. L._ might be?\n\n-- No, sir; however, I think that if we managed to find out, we would learn something more about Sir Charles' death.\n\n-- I don't understand, Barrymore, how you could keep quiet about such an important detail...\n\n-- I had my own troubles – trouble with Seldon, and besides, we were both very attached to Sir Charles, so we preferred to remain silent about this discovery; it couldn't help our poor master anymore, and where a woman is involved, it's better to be cautious.\n\n-- Were you afraid that it would harm his reputation?\n\n-- Yes. But now that you have shown us so much kindness, I consider it my duty to confess this to you.\n\n-- All right, Barrymore, you can go now.\n\nWhen the door closed behind the butler, Sir Henry turned to me:\n\n-- Well, Watson, what do you say to this new light?\n\n-- It only increases the darkness surrounding us on all sides.\n\n-- I think so too. But if we could track down who _L. L._ is, it might shed light on the whole thing. At any rate, we have already gained so much that we know that there is someone who can explain to us the cause of Sir Charles' death. What do you think we should do now?\n\n-- First of all, we must inform Holmes about this. We will give him the key he has been looking for so long; I am almost certain that he will be able to use it.\n\nI immediately went to my room and wrote down our morning conversation to send to Holmes.\n\nLately he has been visibly very busy; I received short letters from him, without any comments on what I reported, almost without mention of our mission. The exploitation case completely absorbs him, and yet so many strange things are happening here that he could be more interested in them.\n\n\nOctober 17th.\n\nIt rained all day. I thought about the murderer on the moor. He has sinned grievously, it's true, but he also atones for his crime grievously. Then I pondered over the mysterious stranger who followed us from the carriage. If it was he who appeared to me against the backdrop of the moon's disc, he must be getting soaked now. In the evening I took my coat and went out onto the moor. The wind whipped my face, the rain poured down my collar. I reached Black-Tor rock, on whose summit the stranger stood then. From its heights I looked out at the grey plain.\n\nTo the left, among the thick clouds, above the trees, the towers of Baskerville Hall stood out. These were the only signs of life; around emptiness and silence, nowhere could I see any traces of that spectral figure which I had noticed a few days ago.\n\nOn my way back, I met Doctor Mortimer. He was driving a carriage. The good doctor shows us a lot of kindness, he visits us almost every day. He invited me into his vehicle and drove me home. I noticed that he was sad; he complained to me that his favourite dog had disappeared: it ran out onto the moor and didn't return. I tried to comfort him, arguing that it would be found, but I remembered the foal that drowned in the Grimpen Mire bogs before my eyes. I doubt the doctor will ever see his pet again.\n\n-- You know everyone here, don't you? -- I asked the doctor.\n\n-- I think so, -- he replied.\n\n-- Couldn't you name a woman whose initials are _L. L._?\n\nHe searched his memory.\n\n-- No, -- he finally said. -- There are a few Gypsy families here that I don't know anything about, but I know all the farmers and local citizens by name. Wait a minute... – he suddenly said. -- There is Laura Lyons – initials _L. L._, but she lives in Coombe-Tracey.\n\n-- Who is that? -- I asked.\n\n-- Old Frankland's daughter.\n\n-- What? So that eccentric has a daughter?\n\n-- He does. She married an artist, named Lyons, who came here to paint the area. He abandoned his wife, although they say she is not without blame. Her father disowned her. The poor woman has a hard life...\n\n-- What does she live on?\n\n-- Old Frankland pays her a certain amount monthly, but not much, because his own affairs are complicated. It was impossible to abandon her and let her perish completely. Several people from the neighbourhood tried to provide her with honest work. Stapleton, Sir Charles, and finally I, did what we could for her. They bought her a typewriter, and in this way she earns a living.\n\nDoctor Mortimer asked about the reason for my inquiries; I satisfied his curiosity without telling him the truth: why should so many people know about that letter?\n\nTomorrow morning I will go to Coombe-Tracey, and if I manage to see Mrs. Laura Lyons, of dubious reputation, one link will be removed from the mysterious chain. I am becoming cunning: when Doctor Mortimer pressed, wanting to know why I am interested in Mrs. Lyons, I subtly asked him what type of skull Mr. Frankland has; thanks to this, until the end of our trip I didn't hear anything else but about craniology. It's not for nothing that I have been in the company of Sherlock Holmes for so many years.\n\nIt only remains for me to note one fact from that day, namely, my conversation with Barrymore. He gave me a new trump card. I intend to use it.\n\nMortimer stayed for dinner, then he and the baronet played _écarté_. The butler brought me coffee to the library; I took advantage of this to ask him a few questions.\n\n-- Well, has Seldon left these parts already? -- I said – is he still roaming around?\n\n-- I expect he's gone; he hasn't given any sign of life since the day I last took him food.\n\n-- Did you see him then?\n\n-- No, sir, but there was no more food when I came a second time.\n\n-- So Seldon took it?\n\n-- One might assume so; unless that other fellow took it...\n\nI looked at the butler with surprise.\n\n-- So you know that another man is hiding on the moor?\n\n-- Yes, sir, I know.\n\n-- Have you seen him?\n\n-- No.\n\n-- How do you know about him?\n\n-- Seldon told me a week ago. That other one is also hiding, but, as far as I can tell, he is not a prisoner. I don't like that at all... – he added mysteriously.\n\n-- Listen, Barrymore, -- I said. -- I came here on your master's business. Tell me openly: what don't you like?\n\nHe hesitated, as if regretting his utterance, or unable to find words to express his thoughts.\n\n-- Some danger threatens Sir Henry... -- he finally said. -- It would be best if he went to London.\n\n-- What worried you?\n\n-- I'll tell you frankly: I foresee a new misfortune... Why is that other fellow hiding on the moor?... This doesn't bode well for the Baskervilles. I wish the new staff would relieve me of the supervision of the mansion.\n\n-- Could you tell me something about this stranger? What does Seldon think of him? Did he find his hiding place? Did he find out what he's doing here?\n\n-- He saw him a few times, but that one is secretive. At first, my brother-in-law mistook him for a spy, but soon he became convinced that he was a gentleman and that he was acting on his own in some mysterious purpose.\n\n-- Didn't Seldon find his hiding place?\n\n-- He knows that the stranger is hiding in one of the caves on the hillside, where ancient people lived.\n\n-- And where does he get food?\n\n-- Seldon spotted that some boy supplies him with everything. This boy goes to Coombe-Tracey.\n\n-- Good, Barrymore. We'll talk about this again.\n\nAfter the butler left, I approached the window and looked out at the dark meadow. The night was cool, windy. What motives could have induced a man to hide on the moor at this time of year?... There, in that cave is the key to the mystery. I vow to myself that I must discover it, and within twenty-four hours.\n\n\nXI.\n\nThe stranger hiding in the cave.\n\n\nThe extract from the diary, forming the last chapter of the story, brought me to October 18th, that is, to the day when these strange events began to unravel. The facts of the following days remained so vivid in my memory that I can tell them without looking at my notes.\n\nSo I begin with the day following the one in which I discovered two very important facts: firstly, that Mrs. Laura Lyons from Coombe-Tracey wrote to Sir Charles Baskerville and arranged a meeting with him at the hour when he met his death; secondly, that the man staying on the moor is hiding in one of the caves on the hillside.\n\nKnowing these two facts, I had in my hand a weapon that could help me to solve this bloody mystery.\n\nI couldn't share my acquired knowledge with the baronet, because Doctor Mortimer stayed until late at night. However, the next day at breakfast I told Sir Charles these circumstances and asked if he wanted to accompany me to Coombe-Tracey.\n\nAt first he was keen to go, but after consideration we both decided that it would be better if I went on this expedition alone. The visit had to be devoid of any ceremonial character. So I left Sir Henry at home and went to reconnoitre.\n\nIt was easy for me to find out Mrs. Lyons' address. She lived in a good part of town, in the centre. I was immediately ushered by a neat maid into the drawing-room. Mrs. Lyons was sitting at her Remington typewriter; she jumped up at my greeting, but seeing a stranger, she became confused and asked what I wanted.\n\nAt first glance, Mrs. Lyons gave the impression of being an extremely beautiful woman: she had golden-brown eyes and hair, a fresh complexion, and full lips. I was captivated by her beauty, but looking closer, I noticed a sharp expression in her mouth and eyes, spoiling the overall harmony. At any rate, I found myself in the presence of a pretty woman, and only now did I feel that my task was difficult. What could I answer her?\n\n-- I know your father, -- I said, explaining my arrival.\n\n-- There is nothing in common between me and my father, -- she replied coldly. -- I owe him absolutely nothing, and his acquaintances are not mine. If it weren't for Sir Charles Baskerville and a few other friends, I would have died of hunger, even though I have a father...\n\n-- I have come to you concerning the late Sir Charles, -- I declared.\n\nShe looked at me with surprise.\n\n-- What can I tell you about him? -- she said, playing with her watch chain.\n\n-- You knew him, didn't you?\n\n-- I've already told you that I owe him a great deal. If I can work for my living, it is mainly thanks to his kindness to me.\n\n-- Did you correspond with him?\n\nA strange gleam lit up her eyes.\n\n-- Why are you asking me? -- she said sharply.\n\n-- To spare you public scandal. It's better for me to know the truth than for it to be revealed to the world...\n\nShe was silent for a long time; finally she looked at me with suppressed anger.\n\n-- All right, I'll answer, -- she said. -- What do you want to know?\n\n-- Did you correspond with Sir Charles? -- I repeated my question.\n",
  "Naturally, I wrote to him to thank him for his kindness and generosity.\n\nDid you remember the dates of your letters?\n\nNo.\n\nDid you see Sir Charles?\n\nYes, a few times when he came to Coombe-Tracey. He lived in isolation. He liked to bestow benefits secretly...\n\nIf he saw you so rarely and received infrequent letters from you, how could he have been so well-informed about your affairs as to come to your aid, as you yourself testified?\n\nShe answered me without hesitation:\n\nSeveral neighbours knew my sad story; they joined forces to help me; among others, Mr. Stapleton, a friend of Sir Charles, was very kind to me. Through him, the baronet learned of my plight.\n\nI knew indeed that Sir Charles had made Stapleton his almsgiver, so I believed these words.\n\nDid you ever write to Sir Baskerville asking him for a private meeting? – I continued.\n\nMrs. Lyons blushed.\n\nThat's a strange question… she said, feigning offense.\n\nI'm sorry, but I must repeat it.\n\nSo – no; I never arranged a meeting with him.\n\nNot on the day of Sir Charles's death? – I said emphatically.\n\nThe blush disappeared from her face; in an instant she turned deathly pale. Her lips moved silently; she whispered \"no\" so softly that I guessed rather than heard the word.\n\nYour memory must be failing you… I said – because I could even quote a passage from her letter, namely: \"I beg and implore you to burn this letter and meet me at the gate at ten o'clock in the evening\".\n\nShe was close to fainting, but she regained her composure.\n\nSo there are no gentlemen left in England!... she whispered bitterly.\n\nYou wrong Sir Charles's memory – I said. – He burned the letter, but one can read a letter even after it's been burned… Do you admit to those words?\n\nYes, I wrote them! – she suddenly exclaimed – I wrote them. I don't need to deny it! I have no reason to be ashamed. I wanted to ask Sir Charles for help. I thought he would give it to me after a private conversation, and that's why I asked him to meet me at the gate.\n\nBut why at that hour…?\n\nBecause I had just learned that he was leaving for London the next day and that his absence would last several months. There were reasons why I couldn't come earlier.\n\nWhy did you arrange a meeting with him in the garden, and not in the mansion?\n\nDo you think a woman can visit an unmarried man at that hour with impunity?\n\nAnd what happened when you arrived at the gate?\n\nI didn't come at all.\n\nMrs. Lyons, I find that hard to believe.\n\nI swear to you on everything that is sacred and dear to me that I am telling the truth. I didn't go because something prevented me.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nIt's a personal, private matter. I can't say.\n\nSo you admit that you arranged a meeting with Sir Charles at the time and place where he was found dead; however, you deny that you appeared at the appointed place…\n\nI'm telling the truth.\n\nI asked her a few more questions, trying to induce a confession, but in vain.\n\nMrs. Lyons – I said, standing up – you are taking on a great responsibility and putting yourself in a difficult position. If I am forced to call for police assistance, then you will see how far you are compromised. If you were innocent, you wouldn't have denied writing to Sir Charles that day in the first instance.\n\nI denied it, for fear that false conclusions would be drawn from it and that I would be implicated in a scandal.\n\nAnd why did you care so much that Sir Charles burn that letter?\n\nIf you read it, you must know why.\n\nI didn't say I read the whole letter.\n\nYou quoted one passage verbatim.\n\nYes, the postscript. The letter, as I mentioned before, was burned and could not be read.  Once again I ask you: why did you insist that Sir Charles burn the letter he received on the day of his death?\n\nIt's a purely personal matter.\n\nAll the more reason you should want to avoid a public investigation.\n\nThen I will tell you. You have probably heard of my sad story, and you must know that I married too hastily and that I had reason to regret it.\n\nI've heard.\n\nMy life has been a series of persecutions from my husband, whom I hate. The law is on his side. Lyons can demand at any moment that I live with him. Before writing that letter to Sir Charles, I had just learned that there was a way to regain my freedom, but that it required considerable expense. It would be peace, happiness, everything in the world for me. I knew Sir Charles's generosity and thought that when he heard this sad story from my own lips, he would undoubtedly help me.\n\nSo why didn't you go to the appointed place?\n\nBecause I received help from another source.\n\nWhy didn't you inform Sir Charles of this?\n\nI would have done so if I hadn't read the news of his death in the newspapers the next day.\n\nMrs. Lyons' words were quite logically connected; I couldn't catch her in a contradiction.  It only remained to check whether she had indeed taken steps towards divorce at that time.\n\nI believed that she wasn't at Baskerville Hall that night, because the horses and vehicle would have been seen at the gate; such an excursion could not have been kept secret. Mrs. Lyons was therefore telling the truth, or part of the truth.\n\nI left discouraged. So once again I was banging my head against a wall, blocking further avenues of discovery! And yet, the more I recalled every feature of her face and every word, the more certain I was that she hadn't told me everything.\n\nWhy did she turn pale at first? Why didn't she immediately confess to the letter?... Undoubtedly, she was more guilty than she presented herself to be.\n\nI had to temporarily rely on her information and turn elsewhere for further information – towards the caves of our prehistoric ancestors.\n\nBut it was not easy to find a stranger based on a general indication. Barrymore told me that the stranger was hiding in one of the caves, but there were many such caves at every turn. However, I remembered the rock on which the figure had appeared to me in the moonlight. That rock, Black Tor, was to serve as my guide. From it I was to begin my search. I promised myself that I would find the stranger and that he must confess to me why he was there. It was easier for him to escape on Regent Street than on this open plain. He slipped through the fingers of the great Holmes. What a triumph it would be for me if I could catch him!\n\nUntil now, luck hadn't been on my side in my investigation – now it smiled upon me. Mr. Frankland was the harbinger of good news.\n\nHe was standing at the gate of his garden, rising by the roadside.\n\nGood day, Doctor Watson! – he addressed me as I passed his residence. – Give your horses a rest, and do come in for a glass of wine.\n\nI didn't harbour friendly feelings towards him after what I had heard about his treatment of his daughter, but I wanted to get rid of groom Perkins with the vehicle and horses as soon as possible. Taking advantage of the opportunity, I got out and told Sir Henry that I would only be back for dinner and that I would come on foot.\n\nI entered Frankland's house.\n\nCongratulate me! – he exclaimed at the outset. – This is a memorable day for me; I will mark it with a red pencil, for it brought me double satisfaction: firstly, it gave me the opportunity to show them that one cannot trample on the law with impunity: I discovered a document stating that a public road should run through old Middleton's park, a hundred yards from the manor. I will teach these magnates that they cannot deprive ordinary mortals of what is rightfully theirs. They think that property rights exist only for them. I haven't had such a pleasant day since I sued Sir John Morland for illegal hunting in his own forest. That case cost me two hundred pounds, but I won it, because on the basis of old records I proved that that part of the forest belonged to the commoners. I must explain to you that I wasn't at all interested. I always act for the public good. Now, the second matter doesn't concern me personally, and yet I discovered something very important.\n\nA moment ago, I was thinking: under what pretext to escape from the eccentric; now he began to interest me, but knowing his perverse nature, I knew that he wouldn't tell me anything if I betrayed my curiosity.\n\nIt's probably about some new trial? – I said indifferently.\n\nHo, ho! my boy, you're wrong. You've probably heard of the fugitive hiding in the moor?\n\nI involuntarily shuddered.\n\nDo you know his hiding place? – I asked.\n\nI couldn't pinpoint it exactly, but my clues would be of service to the police.  Has it not occurred to you that the only way to catch this scoundrel is to trace where and how he receives food; it is along such a trail that one can most easily reach his hiding place.\n\nThe reasoning was very logical.\n\nUndoubtedly – I replied – but how do you know that he is hiding on the moor?\n\nI know, because I saw with my own eyes the one who brings him provisions.\n\nI became worried about Barrymore. It was dangerous to fall prey to the perverse old man. His next words took a weight off my mind.\n\nYou will be surprised to hear that a child provides him with food – he said. – I see the little boy through my telescope, placed on the roof. He always goes along the same path, at the same time. And where would he go, and why, if not to provision the prisoner?\n\nThank God! Frankland was on the wrong track. I pretended that this news was completely indifferent to me.\n\nBarrymore had already told me that the stranger was served by a boy. So Frankland discovered the trail of the mysterious figure, not Seldon. If I can extract more facts from him, it will save me time and trouble. Disbelief could only encourage Frankland to give me more information.\n\nSeeing that I didn't attach importance to his words, he became angry, blushed even more, and looked at me maliciously.\n\nSo you doubt? – he exclaimed. – Look ahead. Do you see the rock called Black Tor? It stands on a bare hill, amidst a wild, stony plain. Do you think this boy is a shepherd? Let me tell you that this assumption is absurd. There is not a blade of grass there, so what would the flock graze on, and without a flock there is no shepherd.\n\nI humbly replied that I acknowledged the inaccuracy of my hypothesis. This disarmed him, prompting further pronouncements.\n\nBelieve me, before I express my opinion, I try to base it on certain data. I see the boy with a bundle every day, and sometimes twice a day. Wait a moment. If my eyes don't deceive me, something is moving on the hill…\n\nWe were a few miles from the given place, but I could clearly see a black speck.\n\nCome on, come on – exclaimed Frankland, running uphill. – You will see with your own eyes and you will be convinced that I am not talking about the wind.\n\nA huge telescope was set up on the roof. Frankland looked through it and cried with joy:\n\nHurry, Doctor, because he's going to the other side of the hill!...\n\nIndeed, I saw a boy carrying a bundle on his back. He was slowly climbing the hill. When he reached the top, I clearly saw his small figure against the sky. He looked around, as if fearing pursuit, then descended the other slope.\n\nWell, what? Am I right? – asked Frankland.\n\nYes, I saw the boy with my own eyes; from his behaviour one can see that he is fulfilling some secret mission.\n\nAnd what kind of mission, it is easy to guess… But I won't utter a word before the police, and I ask you to keep it secret. Not a word, remember!...\n\nIf you insist…\n\nYes, I want to annoy them. They treated me vilely in the matter against the commoners. I don't intend to help the constables. Are you leaving already?... I won't let you! We must celebrate this discovery.\n\nHowever, I was not persuaded and I managed to dissuade him from accompanying me to Baskerville Hall. I kept to the road as long as he could see me, then turned aside and headed towards the hill where the boy had passed.\n\nEverything favoured me; I decided to take advantage of the circumstances and uncover this mystery today.\n\nThe sun was already setting when I reached the top of the hill. The whole plain was plunged into deathly silence. There was no boy anywhere. Looking around among the scattered stones, I saw three, so arranged that they could serve as a hiding place. My heart beat faster. The stranger must have been here.\n\nApproaching, I noticed two stones standing upright; one lay horizontally on them. I entered this rocky den, and I admit, with some apprehension. The place was empty, but there were traces that a human being had inhabited it. On the flat, hollowed-out stone, which undoubtedly served as a bed for the prehistoric man, there was a blanket wrapped in a plaid, on the ground there was still ash from an extinguished fire, next to it were pots and a tin can with water, in the other corner I saw a bottle of gin. In the middle was a flat stone, a kind of table; a bundle lay on it – the same one that I had seen on the boy's back through the telescope. I unwrapped it – there was a loaf of bread, smoked ham and two jars of fruit preserves. Under the provisions lay a piece of paper. I took it in my hand and in the light of a match I read these words, scribbled in pencil, in an unskilled hand:\n\n\"Dr. Watson went to Coombe-Tracey\".\n\nFor a moment I stood with the card in my hand, not understanding the meaning of this notification. So it was not Sir Henry who was being followed, but me… The mysterious stranger, unable to track me himself, had entrusted this to the boy. He probably reported my every move to him.\n\nI looked for other pieces of paper, but in vain; I could not find anything that would explain to me the intentions of the man who had chosen such a strange place of residence. Be that as it may, he was distinguished by Spartan habits… In sultry days, he must have surely had drops falling on his head, he must have been stiff with cold during the cool nights, and yet he did not leave his hiding place. An important goal undoubtedly chained him to this den… I vowed to myself that I would not leave here until I knew whether this man was our friend or enemy.\n\nThe sun was already setting low, in the glow of gold and purple; on one side stood the towers of Baskerville Hall, on the other were the Grimpen Mire bogs, and to the right, the Stapletons' house rose. Peace reigned in nature, only my soul was agitated. I sat down at the entrance to the cave and waited for the arrival of its occupant.\n\nFinally, I heard the sound of his footsteps. I slipped into the darkest corner and took the revolver out of my pocket. The steps stopped, suddenly a shadow obscured the opening.\n\nWe have a beautiful evening, dear Watson – said a voice, well known to me. – I think you'll be better off in the open air than here…\n\n\nXII.\n\nDeath on the Moor.\n\n\nFor a moment I sat breathless, not believing my own eyes, finally I regained my voice, my consciousness returned, and at the same time a weight of responsibility fell from my heart. Only one man in the world had such an ironic, cold voice.\n\nSherlock! – I exclaimed.\n\nCome out, and please be careful with that revolver.\n\nI stood in the stone opening and saw Holmes a few steps in front of me. He was sitting on a stone and looking at me cheerfully. He was pale, emaciated, his face tanned, but his linen was so clean, and his beard so carefully shaved, as if he were in his Baker Street apartment.\n\nHow glad I am it's you! – I exclaimed, shaking his hand.\n\nAren't you surprised? – he asked.\n\nI admit that I am.\n\nAnd I am surprised too – he replied. – I didn't expect you to find my hiding place, much less to find you here. I only noticed your presence when I was twenty paces from this cave.\n\nDid you recognize me by my footprints?\n\nNo, Watson, I wouldn't be able to distinguish your tracks from among others. But if you want to deceive me, I advise you to use other cigarettes, because whenever I see a mouthpiece with the Broadley, Oxford Street brand, I always guess that my friend Watson is nearby. Look, you dropped an unfinished cigarette, probably when you decided to enter this cave.\n\nIndeed.\n\nThat's what I assumed, and knowing your courage, I was sure that you were lurking with a revolver in your hand, waiting for the return of the \"occupant\" of this dwelling. So you thought I was the criminal?\n\nI didn't know who you were, but I vowed to uncover the mystery.\n\nWhen did you learn about the presence of another man on the moor? Did you perhaps see me that night when I was so careless and stood against the backdrop of the moon?\n\nYes, I saw you then.\n\nAnd you undoubtedly looked under all the stones before you stumbled upon my hiding place?\n\nNo; your boy was seen, and that served as my guide.\n\nThe old gentleman probably saw him through the telescope. When I first saw the gleam from the lens, I couldn't figure out what it was.\n\nHe stood up and went into the cave.\n\nHa! I see that Cartwright brought me provisions… And there's the scribbled paper. So you went to Coombe-Tracey?\n\nYes.\n\nTo talk to Mrs. Laura Lyons?\n\nNo other.\n\nGood. Very good! Our investigations went along parallel paths, and when we combine our research, we must get to the bottom of the truth.\n\nI'm immensely glad you're here, because my nerves were starting to fail me. But how did you find yourself on the moor and what are you doing here? I thought you were sitting peacefully at Baker Street and dealing with the exploitation case.\n\nI wanted you to think so.\n\nSo you use me for work, yet you don't trust me… – I exclaimed bitterly. – It seems to me that I have earned your trust.\n\nMy dear fellow, you are simply invaluable; on many occasions you have rendered me excellent services, I am grateful to you and I hope you will forgive me this trick. I resorted to it partly for your sake: knowing the danger you are exposing yourself to, I wanted to examine it myself, on the spot. If I had stayed with you and Sir Henry, I would probably have shared your views on this matter, and my presence would have forced our opponent to be doubly vigilant. In the present state of affairs, I have accomplished what I could not have done while living at Baskerville Hall, and besides, I remain in hiding. At the time of need, I will appear with all my energy and strength.\n\nBut why did you hide from me?\n\nBecause otherwise you would not have refrained from communicating with me; you would have wanted to provide me with better food, warmer clothes, and you would have led those people to my trail. I brought Cartwright with me – you remember the boy from the hotel – he thought of me: he brought me bread and clean linen. What more do I need? He also gave me a pair of sharp eyes and a pair of nimble legs, which is desirable.\n\nSo my letters were unnecessary?\n\nHolmes took out a packet of letters.\n\nHere are your reports – he said. – I received them with a 24-hour delay and they rendered me considerable service. I must praise you for the zeal and ingenuity you have demonstrated in this unusual case.\n\nHolmes' heartfelt words dispelled my resentment towards him, all the more so because I felt that it was better that I hadn't known about his presence on the moor.\n\nAnd now tell me about your visit to Mrs. Lyons – he said. – It wasn't difficult for me to guess that you went to her, because I know that she alone in Coombe-Tracey can provide us with the necessary information. Of course, if you hadn't spoken to her today, I would have gone to her tomorrow.\n\nThe sun had already set, the air had cooled. We went into the cave. Sitting on the stone next to Holmes, I told him about my conversation with Mrs. Lyons.\n",
  "This is a very important detail,\" he confirmed.  \"It fills a gap I haven't been able to close. You know, of course, that there's a very close relationship between that lady and Stapleton...?\"\n\n\"I didn't know.\"\n\n\"It's certain... They see each other, write to each other, are in close understanding... This news is a dangerous weapon in our hands. If only we could dissuade his wife from Stapleton!\"\n\n\"Wife?\"\n\n\"Now I'll give you a handful of information in return for the ones you've given me. The lady who passes here as Miss Stapleton is, in fact, his wife.\"\n\n\"That's impossible! Does he allow Sir Henry to pursue his own wife...?\"\n\n\"What harm does it do him that Sir Henry is in love?  He, on his part, as you yourself have noticed, has done everything to prevent Sir Henry from revealing or expressing his feelings... I repeat: this beautiful lady is not his sister, but Stapleton's wife.\"\n\n\"Then why this comedy?\"\n\n\"Stapleton anticipated that she might be of service to him as a free woman.\"\n\nAll my suspicions came alive. This cold, impenetrable man, for whom I felt an aversion from the first moment, now seemed to me a monster with a sweet smile.\n\n\"He, and no one else, is our enemy; he followed us in London!...\" Holmes declared.\n\n\"And the warning surely came from her?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" confirmed my friend.\n\n\"How did you find out that this woman is his wife?\" I asked.\n\n\"Thanks to the fact that he himself revealed a certain detail of his life; I think he must regret this carelessness. At our first meeting, he mentioned that he once ran a school in northern England. Now, there's nothing easier than to track down a teacher. There are school agencies through which you can learn the details of every teacher's life, and even more so of a headmaster. After a short investigation, I found that one school was closed due to terrible abuses. The name of its headmaster was different; this man disappeared without a trace. The description matched, and when I also learned that this headmaster was passionately devoted to entomology, I had no more doubts.\"\n\n\"If this woman is indeed his wife, what is his relationship to Mrs. Lyons?\"\n\n\"Your conversation with that lady shed light on this dark point. I didn't know that Mrs. Lyons wanted a divorce. Apparently, she hopes to marry Stapleton.\"\n\n\"And if her hopes are dashed?\"\n\n\"Ha! Then she will be at our service. First of all, we both must see her tomorrow. But don't you find, Watson, that you've left your patient unattended for too long?... Your place is now at Baskerville Hall.\"\n\nThe last rays of the sun were fading in the west.\n\n\"One more question,\" I said, standing up. \"There shouldn't be any secrets between us. Tell me, what is his goal?\"\n\nHolmes lowered his voice.\n\n\"His goal is... murder – cold, sophisticated,\" he replied. \"Don't ask me for details. I'm ensnaring him in a net, just as he – Sir Henry. I only fear that he will carry out his plan before we are ready to fight. One more day, two at most, and I will be able to confront this villain, but meanwhile, guard Sir Henry; I even regret that you left him today.\"\n\nA terrible howl broke the silence. My blood ran cold.\n\n\"What was that?\" I cried.\n\nHolmes leaped to his feet, ran out in front of the cave, and listened.\n\n\"Quiet!\" he whispered. \"Quiet!\"\n\nThe same howl repeated itself closer, fear and pain resonating within it.\n\n\"Where is it coming from?\" Holmes asked in a whisper.\n\n\"It seems to me from over there,\" I replied, pointing to the left.\n\n\"No, no,\" he contradicted.\n\nAnd again, a cry tore through the silence, full of despair and terror.  A wild growl accompanied it this time.\n\n\"It's a dog!\" Holmes exclaimed. \"Let's run to help! Faster! Faster!\"\n\nHe rushed forward, I behind him. For the third time, a human cry and a terrible growl reached our ears. We stood, listening. Silence fell again.\n\nHolmes wrung his hands. I had never seen him so helpless.\n\n\"Too late, too late!...\" he said despairingly. \"That I sat here like a fool, with my hands folded!... And you, how could you leave Sir Henry without your care!...\"\n\nWe ran on through the enveloping fog and ever-increasing darkness.\n\n\"Do you see anything?\" Holmes asked me.\n\n\"No,\" I replied.\n\n\"And what is that?\" he suddenly exclaimed.\n\nA rattling sound could be heard. It came from behind a bare rock, standing before us. We ran up, and a terrible sight presented itself to our eyes. At the foot of the rock, face down, with outstretched arms, lay a man, already dead. That rattling was his last breath.\n\nI struck a match – in its light we saw something that made our blood freeze; the dead body of Sir Charles Baskerville.\n\nWe both knew the checkered suit – the same one in which he first appeared to us in Holmes's apartment. The match went out, and with it, the hope in our hearts.\n\n\"I will never forgive myself for leaving him alone...\" I whispered.\n\n\"I am even more to blame, Watson. To 'round off' and 'complete' the evidence, I risked my client's life... This is the greatest blow I have ever received in my profession!... But how could we have foreseen that despite our pleas and warnings, he would go alone into that cursed bog...?\"\n\n\"To think that we heard his cries and couldn't come to his aid.... Where is that cursed dog? Any moment it might jump out from behind the rock... And where is Stapleton? We'll bring him to justice!\"\n\n\"Yes, I will not fail to do so,\" said Holmes. \"The uncle and the nephews were murdered! – there is no doubt about that. One was frightened to death by the mere sight of this beast, which he took for a supernatural phenomenon; the other fell from the rock, fleeing from this monster... But the connection between the dog and its victim must be shown. How will we prove the existence of this four-legged monster?... Sir Henry apparently died as a result of the fall. But despite all his cunning, Stapleton will not escape the hands of the police!...\"\n\nWe stood over the corpse, helpless in the face of the catastrophe that had rendered all our efforts useless. Finally, the moon descended; we climbed to the top of the rock from which our unfortunate friend had fallen and surveyed the gloomy plain, now silvered by the gentle glow of the moon.\n\nFar away, in the direction of Grimpen Mire, a yellow light shone. It undoubtedly burned in Stapleton's house. I clenched my fist in impotent rage.\n\n\"Let's arrest him right now!\" I shouted.\n\n\"We don't have enough evidence yet,\" countered Holmes. \"This scoundrel is cunning, he knows how to defend himself. It's not about what we know, but about what we can prove. One wrong step, and he'll slip through our fingers.\"\n\n\"What remains for us now?\"\n\n\"We will consult tomorrow; today we must think about paying our last respects to our friend.\"\n\nWe descended from the rock and approached the corpse, now illuminated by the moon.\n\n\"We must bring people,\" I said. \"Two of us cannot carry him to Baskerville Hall. What's wrong with you? Are you mad...?\"\n\nHolmes, looking at the corpse, laughed, rubbing his hands. What had happened to my usually serious friend...?\n\n\"The beard! The beard! This man had a beard!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"A beard?\" I picked up.\n\n\"This isn't Sir Henry. It's my neighbor – the convict!\"\n\nWith feverish haste, we turned the corpse face to the moon. There was no doubt: the bloodied forehead, sunken eyes, red beard – it was Seldon.\n\nIn one moment, I understood how things were. The baronet had told me that he had given his old clothes to Barrymore. Apparently, Barrymore, at his wife's request, gave them to Seldon to facilitate his escape. The boots, the cap, the suit – everything was Sir Henry's. A terrible fate befell the prisoner, but this man deserved punishment and would have received it from the hand of justice. I explained the cause of our mistake to Holmes.\n\n\"This clothing is the reason for Seldon's death,\" he said. \"Obviously, the dog was trained to recognize Sir Henry by his clothing. I now understand why the boot disappeared from the hotel; the dog smelled the scent of the convict's clothes and chased him. Only one thing puzzles me: how could Seldon, in the darkness, see that the dog was chasing him...?\"\n\n\"He heard the growling, just like we did.\"\n\n\"The dog's growling alone wouldn't have frightened him so much that he would call for help, betraying his presence and risking being caught by the guards. From his cries, I judge that he ran a considerable distance from the place where the dog scared him.\"\n\n\"And I don't understand why the dog was let loose just today. I think it's not always free. If Stapleton let him off the chain, then he probably expected Sir Henry to be crossing the bog.\"\n\n\"What shall we do with this corpse now? It's impossible to leave him here at the mercy of wild birds.\"\n\n\"It's best to put him in one of the caves until we notify the police.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Holmes conceded. \"We can probably lift him between the two of us? But look... Watson... it's _him_!... What audacity!... Not a word to him about our suspicions... not a word! Otherwise, all my plans will be ruined.\"\n\nI saw the glow of a cigar. In the moonlight, I clearly saw the small figure of the naturalist.  Having noticed us, he stopped, but after a moment he continued walking.\n\n\"Who do I see!\" he said. \"If my eyes don't deceive me, Doctor Watson. I didn't expect to meet you here... What is this?... Someone was injured... No, that's impossible... Our friend, Sir Henry!...\"\n\nHe ran up and bent over the corpse. I heard his accelerated breathing, the cigar fell from his hands.\n\n\"Who is it? Who is this?\" he whispered.\n\n\"It's Seldon, the prisoner who escaped from Princetown.\"\n\nStapleton turned pale terribly, but with a superhuman effort, he mastered the feeling of bitter disappointment. He shifted his gaze from Holmes to me and from me to Holmes.\n\n\"What a terrible affair!\" he said. \"How did he die?\"\n\n\"He broke his neck falling from this rock. I was walking with my friend when a terrifying cry reached us.\"\n\n\"And I heard that cry. That's what brought me here. I was worried about Sir Henry...\"\n\n\"Why specifically about Sir Henry...?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because he was supposed to come to me. Because he was late, I went out to meet him and then I heard the cry... But, truth be told...\" – and again he shifted his gaze from my face to Holmes's face – \"didn't you gentlemen hear anything else besides that cry?\"\n\n\"No, and you?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"Neither did I.\"\n\n\"Then what does this question mean?\"\n\n\"I was thinking about the legends circulating among the villagers... It is said that barking can be heard at night... I was curious if similar sounds were heard now...\"\n\n\"We heard nothing,\" I replied.\n\n\"And how do you gentlemen explain the death of this villain?\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" I said, \"that something frightened him; he ran away, ran blindly, until he stumbled and fell from this rock headfirst. He killed himself on the spot, because the rock is high and on this side it drops perpendicularly into the valley; the other side connects with the plateau. Running, the prisoner in his terror did not notice that he was standing over an abyss.\"\n\n\"That's very plausible,\" Stapleton admitted, and sighed with visible relief, as if a stone had fallen from his heart. \"And what do you think about it, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"I suppose the same as my friend.\"\n\n\"We've been expecting you since Doctor Watson arrived here. You appear at a tragic moment...\"\n\n\"I hope that my friend's explanation will be considered the only possible one.  After all, returning to London tomorrow, I will carry away from here an unpleasant memory...\"\n\n\"So you're returning tomorrow?\"\n\n\"I intend to.\"\n\n\"I expect that your investigations will shed light on the mysterious affair that has occupied us for several months.\"\n\n\"And I doubt it,\" Holmes replied with perfectly feigned sincerity.  \"A detective in his reasoning usually relies on facts, not on folk legends. This is a difficult and complicated matter. I don't expect to unravel it.\"\n\nStapleton looked at him sharply, then turned to me:\n\n\"I would gladly offer to move this poor fellow to our place, but I'm afraid to frighten my sister. It's best to cover Seldon's face, and the body will be safe until tomorrow morning.\"\n\nSo we did. Stapleton invited us to his home, but we excused ourselves, and we both went to Baskerville Hall. The naturalist returned alone.\n\n\"We almost have him...\" said Holmes. \"And what presence of mind! What cold blood!... How boldly he looked at the corpse of the one he considered his victim... I told you in London, and now I repeat, that I have never had such a dangerous opponent.\"\n\n\"I regret that he saw us.\"\n\n\"And I regretted it at first; but there was no other way.\"\n\n\"Do you think that the knowledge that you are here will affect his plans?\"\n\n\"It will force him to be cautious, and may prompt him to take final action. Like many clever criminals, he is probably overconfident in his intellect and imagines that he will mislead us.\"\n\n\"And why don't we arrest him right now?\"\n\n\"Dear Watson, you are made for a man of action. Your first impulse is – to act. But supposing we arrest him tonight, what good will it do us? We won't be able to prove anything to him. If he had an accomplice, we could find evidence; but even if we find the dog, it won't help us put the noose around his master's neck.\"\n\n\"We do have proof, though.\"\n\n\"Not a single one – only assumptions and conclusions. The court would laugh at us if we stood before it with such evidentiary material.\"\n\n\"We can refer to the death of Sir Charles...\"\n\n\"He was found dead without any signs of violence, without wounds or cuts. We both know that he died of fright, we also know who frightened him, but how will we translate this belief into twelve jurors?... What marks did the dog leave on the body?... Naturally, we know that no dog will touch a dead body; we further know that Sir Charles breathed his last before this wild animal caught up with him. We know, but we should _prove_ it – and we cannot.\"\n\n\"The fact that happened today, isn't that important circumstantial evidence?\"\n\n\"We won't be able to prove the connection between the dog and the death of this man. Besides, we didn't see the dog; we only heard it, and we can't prove that it chased Seldon or anyone else. No, my dear fellow, we must come to terms with the idea that we must wait and act from concealment.\"\n\n\"What are your plans?\"\n\n\"I expect a lot from Mrs. Lyons, and I hope that tomorrow we will obtain at least one piece of evidence.\"\n\nI couldn't get him to express his intentions more clearly. He walked in silence all the way to the palace.\n\n\"Will you come in?\" I asked.\n\n\"Of course; further hiding is unnecessary. Listen, Watson: don't mention the dog to Sir Henry. After all, the baronet was invited to dinner at the Stapletons tomorrow?\"\n\n\"And they asked me.\"\n\n\"You must excuse yourself. He will go alone. That's easy to arrange. Now let's go. You were late for dinner, but we arrive just in time for supper.\"\n\n\nXIII.\n\nSetting the Net.\n\n\nSir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Holmes; he expected that recent events would prompt him to come. He couldn't understand, however, why my friend didn't bring any luggage. We provided him with everything he needed, and then, over a hearty supper, we told the baronet about our adventure, omitting certain details.\n\nBut first, I had the unpleasant duty of informing the Barrymores of Seldon's death. For the husband, it was somewhat good news, but the wife wept bitterly at the news. In the eyes of everyone, this criminal was a monster and an outcast of society; she always saw in him a boy with bright curls, whom she carried in her arms and loved like her own child.\n\nThere is no such bad man for whom a woman would not cry...\n\n\"After Watson left,\" said the baronet, \"I paced from corner to corner, faithful to my promise: not to venture alone into the bog after sunset. Now, however, I regret that I didn't accept Stapleton's invitation, which he wrote to me late in the evening. If I had gone, I would have spent the evening more pleasantly.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it,\" said Holmes. \"But, truth be told, I forgot to tell you that we already mourned him. We were sure it was you who died.\"\n\nSir Henry looked at him in surprise.\n\n\"This poor fellow was dressed from head to toe in your clothes. I fear that Barrymore, who supplied them to him, will have a run-in with the police...\"\n\n\"I doubt it. There were no marks.\"\n\n\"That's fortunate for him, and even for us, since you are not without blame in this matter either. You would be held accountable for the fact that, knowing the hiding place of the escaped convict, you did not inform the police about it... As a conscientious detective, I should even arrest you and the entire palace staff...\"\n\n\"Before you fulfill this duty,\" said the baronet jokingly, \"perhaps I'll find out how our case stands? Have you untangled its intricacies? Watson and I know as much today as at the beginning.\"\n\n\"I hope I can reveal the mystery. The matter is indeed very complicated, there are many dark points in it, but I expect to shed light on them,\"\n\n\"Here, Watson and I have only established one fact: the dog barking in the bog. We heard it clearly, so it's not a legend or superstition. If you managed to catch this dog, you would be the foremost detective in the world.\"\n\n\"I hope I will catch him and muzzle him, but I need your help.\"\n\n\"Use me as you wish. I will do whatever you want.\"\n\n\"Then I'll ask you to listen to me blindly.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"If you follow my instructions and orders without questioning their reason, then I may be able to unravel the mystery. I have no doubt...\"\n\nHe suddenly stopped and stared at a point above my head. The light fell on his motionless face, as if carved from stone.\n\n\"What do you see there?\" exclaimed Sir Henry.\n\nLooking at Sherlock, I noticed that he was suppressing inner turmoil. His features were cold, as usual, but a strange fire burned in his eyes.\n\n\"It was the delight of a connoisseur...\" he said after a moment, pointing to a row of portraits hanging on the opposite wall. \"Watson doesn't believe in my connoisseurship, but it's out of envy, because our views on art are incompatible. In my opinion, this gallery of portraits is magnificent.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that,\" replied Sir Henry, looking at my friend with surprise. \"I don't know anything about painting: I prefer a fine horse to a valuable picture. I didn't think you had time to indulge in such hobbies...\"\n\n\"I cannot be indifferent to masterpieces when I have them before my eyes,\" replied Holmes. \"I could bet that this lady in a blue satin dress and that elderly gentleman in a wig came from the brush of Reynolds. After all, these are all family portraits?\"\n\n\"Yes, all of them.\"\n\n\"Do you know the names and dates?\"\n\n\"Barrymore tried to initiate me into genealogies and I think I remembered his lecture.\"\n\n\"Who is that gentleman with a telescope in his hand?\"\n\n\"That's Admiral Baskerville; he served in the West Indies under Rodney. And the one in the blue coat is Sir William Baskerville, who was Speaker of the House of Commons in Pitt's time.\"\n\n\"And that horseman, opposite me, in a velvet spencer?\"\n\n\"Oh! That one is worth saying a few words about. He is the cause of our family's misfortunes. That's the bloody Hugo, who unleashed a pack of dogs on that unfortunate girl...\"\n\nI looked at the portrait with great interest.\n\n\"I would never have guessed it was him,\" said Holmes. \"A gentle, calm face, only in the eyes... flames. I imagined him as stronger and more menacing.\"\n",
  "There's no doubt it's him. On the back of the canvas is a name and date – the year 1647.\n\nMy friend fell silent, but didn't take his eyes off the portrait.  Only after we had retired for the night did I learn why this canvas aroused such lively interest in him.\n\nHe led me back to the dining room with a candle in his hand and held it close to the portrait.\n\n\"What strikes you?\" he asked.\n\nI surveyed the large feathered hat, the golden curls, and the lace collar; I stared at the cold, harsh features. There was no passion in them, but an unwavering, cruel will; it shone from the steely eyes, betrayed by the narrow, compressed lips.\n\n\"Does this portrait remind you of any of your acquaintances?\" Holmes asked.\n\n\"The lower part of the face is somewhat similar to Sir Henry's.\"\n\n\"Indeed. But wait.\"\n\nHe jumped onto a chair, and holding the candle in his left hand, he shielded the wide hat and hair with his right.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I exclaimed.\n\nStapleton's face emerged from the frame of the painting...\n\n\"Aha! You've finally noticed!\" said Holmes. \"My eyes are accustomed to examining faces themselves, without their accessory finery. The first virtue of a detective is to recognize people in disguise.\"\n\n\"But it's extraordinary!\" I said, unable to contain my astonishment. \"This painting could be his portrait!\"\n\n\"Yes, it's physical evidence of atavism and moral similarity. Studies of family portraits can instill in us a belief in the transmigration of souls. This man is of the Baskerville lineage, there's no doubt about it.\"\n\n\"And that's why he's eyeing the inheritance...\"\n\n\"Naturally. The portrait filled a gap in my investigation. We'll keep it, Watson! I'm ready to bet that tomorrow he'll fall into my nets, just like the butterflies he chases himself. I'll pin him down and add him to my collection of criminals.\"\n\nHe burst out laughing, which rarely happened to him.\n\nThe next morning I got up very early, but Holmes had already beaten me. He was dressed to go out.\n\n\"We have the whole day free,\" he said, rubbing his hands with glee. \"The nets are already set, only the butterfly is missing.\"\n\n\"Have you already gone out?\"\n\n\"I sent a message to Princetown about Seldon's death. I hope none of you will be troubled in this matter. I've also already spoken with the loyal Cartwright; he circled around my den like a dog over its master's grave. I had to reassure him that I'm safe and sound.\"\n\n\"What next?\"\n\n\"We'll greet Sir Henry. Aha! Here he is!\"\n\n\"Good morning, Holmes,\" said the baronet, entering the dining room. \"You look like a commander consulting with his chief of staff before a battle.\"\n\n\"Because that's exactly what's happening. Watson is receiving orders.\"\n\n\"And I'm ready to hear them.\"\n\n\"Stapleton invited you to dinner today, didn't he?\"\n\n\"I expect you gentlemen will come with me. They are very hospitable and I guarantee they will receive you with open arms.\"\n\n\"Both Watson and I must go to London.\"\n\n\"To London?\"\n\n\"Yes; our presence is more needed there than here.\"\n\n\"I had hoped,\" declared the baronet, \"that you wouldn't leave me until this matter is resolved. What will I do here alone in this wasteland?\"\n\n\"My dear sir, you must trust me blindly and do as I say. You will tell the Stapletons that we were very keen to accompany you, but that important business has called us to London. We expect to return soon. Will you repeat this to them verbatim?\"\n\n\"If you wish.\"\n\nI saw that the baronet was unhappy about our departure and that he resented our leaving him.\n\n\"When do you want to leave?\" he asked coldly.\n\n\"Right after breakfast. We'll stop at Coombe-Tracey. Watson will leave his suitcase here as proof that he will return soon. Write a few words to Stapleton, apologizing that you cannot accept his invitation.\"\n\n\"I feel like going with you,\" said the baronet. \"What keeps me here?\"\n\n\"You gave me your word that you would follow my instructions, and I tell you to stay.\"\n\n\"Ha! In that case, I'll stay.\"\n\n\"One more thing. You will go to Merripit House by the American car.  Send the horses back immediately and state that you intend to return on foot.\"\n\n\"Am I to go across the moor?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But that contradicts your previous advice! You both warned me not to go out onto the moor or the meadow after sunset.\"\n\n\"This time you can go safely. If I didn't trust your courage and cool head, I wouldn't give you such advice. Believe me, it's necessary.\"\n\n\"Very well then.\"\n\n\"But if you value your life, don't stray from the path; you must go straight along the path leading from Merripit House to Grimpen Road.\"\n\n\"All right, I'll remember.\"\n\n\"I would like to leave here right after breakfast to be in London before evening.\"\n\nI was surprised by this plan; although Holmes had mentioned to Stapleton the previous day that he was going to the city the next day, I didn't think he would take me with him and I couldn't understand why he was abandoning his post at the most crucial moment. However, I remained silent, knowing that I had to listen to him passively.\n\nWe said goodbye to our friend and a couple of hours later we were at the station in Coombe-Tracey. The horses were sent home. A small boy stood on the platform.\n\n\"What are your orders?\" he asked Holmes.\n\n\"You will take this train to London. Immediately upon arrival, you will telegraph to Sir Henry Baskerville on my behalf, asking him to have him search for the cigarette case I left with him and send it to Baker Street.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Ask at the station if there's a letter for me.\"\n\nThe boy returned with a telegram, Holmes handed it to me. I read the following:\n\n\"Telegram received. Arriving with unsigned order. Will be there at 5:40 p.m. Lestrade.\"\n\n\"That's the answer to my telegram sent this morning. We will need his help. A clever and courageous man. And now, Watson, I think we have nothing left but to visit your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.\"\n\nI began to understand the plan of the campaign. Holmes, through the baronet, wanted to convince the Stapletons that we had indeed left, and we, in the meantime, would appear at the moment of impending danger.\n\nThis telegram from London, which Sir Henry will surely mention, will dispel the naturalist's suspicions.\n\nThe nets were already set.\n\nMrs. Laura Lyons was in her office. Sherlock Holmes got straight to the point with a frankness that put her in trouble.\n\n\"I'm investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of Sir Charles Baskerville,\" he declared. \"My friend, Dr. Watson, informed me of the content of his conversation with you, I also know what you kept silent about...\"\n\n\"What did I keep silent about?\"\n\n\"You confessed that, at her request, Sir Charles was to be at the gate at ten o'clock – we know that he met his death at that hour. You didn't explain the relationship between these two facts.\"\n\n\"They are in no relation to each other.\"\n\n\"It would be a strange coincidence. However, I think we will be able to demonstrate the connection between one fact and the other. I want to be completely frank with you. We consider this 'accident' to be murder; not only is your friend, Mr. Stapleton, suspected, but also his wife...\"\n\nMrs. Lyons sprang to her feet.\n\n\"His wife?...\" she cried.\n\n\"Yes. The matter has come to light. The person who until now passed for his sister is actually his wife...\"\n\nMrs. Lyons sat down again, her fingers gripping the armrest of the chair with such force that her nails turned white.\n\n\"His wife!\" she whispered. \"His wife! So he's married!...\"\n\nSherlock Holmes spread his hands as if to say there was nothing he could do about it.\n\n\"I want proof. If you can substantiate these words with facts...\" She didn't finish, her voice died in her chest.\n\n\"I came prepared with evidence, knowing that you would demand it,\" Holmes declared, taking a packet of papers from his pocket. \"Here is a photograph of the couple, taken several years ago in York. They are registered in the photographic studio's books as 'Mr. and Mrs. Vandelour', but it's easy to recognize both her and him. Further – three sketches of Mr. and Mrs. Vandelour; the husband at that time was the headmaster of a private school in St. Oliver. The sketches were sent by reliable people. Read them, madam, and see if they correspond to the appearance of Mr. Stapleton and his supposed sister.\"\n\nShe scanned the list and fell silent. She seemed to stiffen with pain.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" she finally said, \"this man promised to marry me if I obtained a divorce. He lied to me, betrayed me. I imagined that he was acting for me – now I see that I was only a tool in his hands. I don't need to keep his secret, since he didn't keep faith with me!... I don't intend to shield him from the consequences of his wicked deeds. Ask me anything you want – I will hide nothing. I swear to you that when I wrote this letter, I did not know that I was endangering Sir Charles, who was better to me than a father.\"\n\n\"I believe you wholeheartedly,\" replied Sherlock Holmes. \"Telling the story would be very unpleasant for you, so perhaps it's better if I tell you how things were, and you will correct any inaccuracies or mistakes. After all, Stapleton advised you to write this letter?\"\n\n\"He dictated it to me.\"\n\n\"I presume he persuaded you, arguing that Sir Charles would gladly cover the expenses of the divorce.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And when you sent your letter, he dissuaded you from coming to the appointed place.\"\n\n\"He said that his ambition didn't allow a stranger to pay for such a purpose, and that although he himself was poor, he would sacrifice his last penny to remove the obstacles blocking our path to happiness.\"\n\n\"And then you read about the death in the local newspaper?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then he made you swear not to mention your letter to Sir Charles to anyone?\"\n\n\"He said that death is mysterious and that they might suspect me of murder. He frightened me with this argument and forced me to silence.\"\n\n\"Did you have any doubts?\"\n\nShe was silent for a long time, then said:\n\n\"Perhaps, because I know him. But if he had kept faith with me, I would never have betrayed him.\"\n\n\"Be that as it may, you came out of this affair unscathed,\" Holmes reassured her. \"You had him in your power, and yet you live. And now we shall bid you farewell. Until soon!\"\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Our case is beginning to round itself off,\" said Holmes, when a few minutes later we were standing at the station, waiting for the London train. \"This is the strangest crime that has happened in our century. Criminologists remember a similar case in Grodno in 1866, and another in North Carolina in 1878, but the present case has its own peculiarities. And even now, after discovering the details, I still don't know how Stapleton contributed to Sir Charles's death. However, I hope this will be resolved before midnight.\"\n\nThe London courier rushed onto the platform with a hiss and a whistle. A stocky man with a cheerful face jumped out of the first-class carriage. He greeted Holmes with the respect of an officer greeting the commander-in-chief of the army.\n\n\"Anything new?\" he asked.\n\n\"It seems that this case will cause a stir,\" replied my friend, rubbing his hands. \"We have two hours free. We must have lunch and gather our strength for action. After lunch, we will take a walk across the moor; the fresh air will clear the London fog from your lungs. After all, this is your first time here? I hope you won't forget this visit...\"\n\n\nXIV.\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles.\n\n\nOne of Sherlock Holmes's flaws – if it can be called a flaw – is secrecy. He doesn't usually reveal his plans to anyone until the last moment. This is a result of his despotic and independent nature, but also a bit of vanity. He likes to amaze and enthrall with his investigative genius. Besides, this secrecy may also stem from caution, which prevents him from speaking out in front of anyone. Be that as it may, it is unpleasant for those around him.\n\nThis often made me impatient, but never to the extent it did that evening. We had a difficult and dangerous task ahead of us, we were to act together, yet Holmes didn't assign us roles. We talked about secondary matters, having nothing to do with the case.\n\nMy friend hired a carriage at the station and had himself driven to Baskerville Hall. We got out at the gate. He paid the driver and dismissed him to Coombe-Tracey, then told us to follow him towards Merripit House.\n\n\"Do you have a weapon?\" Lestrade asked.\n\n\"I never part with my revolver,\" the detective replied. \"During the day it's glued to my trouser pocket, and at night – to my pillow.\"\n\n\"That's good. My friend and I are fully armed.\"\n\n\"What are your orders?\"\n\n\"To wait.\"\n\n\"Ha! This is not a pleasant job, especially in such surroundings. What a wasteland!...,\" said Lestrade, looking around.\n\n\"Do you see those lights in the distance? That's Merripit House, the destination of our trip. Now we must walk on tiptoe and speak in whispers.\"\n\nTwo hundred yards from the house, Sherlock told us to stop.\n\n\"We'll wait here,\" he whispered. \"These stones to the right provide excellent cover. Hide behind them, Lestrade. You've been in this house, Watson? You know the layout of the rooms. Do you see the lit window?\"\n\n\"That's the kitchen.\"\n\n\"And that one, on the other side?\"\n\n\"That's the dining room.\"\n\n\"Please, sneak up to those windows and see what they're doing there, but for heaven's sake, carefully, so they don't realize they're being followed.\"\n\nI walked slowly, on tiptoe; bent over, I reached a place from where I could see the dining room window.\n\nTwo men were sitting at a round table: Sir Henry and Stapleton.\n\nThey were facing me in profile. Both were smoking cigars and drinking coffee. A bottle of wine stood before them. Stapleton was talking animatedly, the baronet was pale and distracted. Perhaps he was troubled by the thought of returning alone through that fatal bog.\n\nAfter a while, Stapleton got up and left the room. Sir Henry took a sip of coffee and took a puff of his cigar. I heard the creak of the door and the crunch of gravel: someone was walking on the other side of the wall. I cautiously looked out and saw the naturalist. He walked slowly, sneaking as it were, finally stopped at the door of the side outbuilding. The key rattled in the lock, after a moment I heard a strange sound, like growling. Stapleton stayed for a few minutes and returned to the house. I saw him enter the room where he had left Sir Henry.\n\nI returned to my companions to report to Holmes.\n\n\"So you say the lady is absent?\" he asked, after listening to me to the end.\n\n\"She's not in the dining room.\"\n\n\"Are all the other rooms dark? Where is she hiding?...\"\n\nWhite vapors rose above the moor; the bright moon in the sky failed to disperse them. The whole area seemed covered with snow.\n\n\"Damn fog!\" Holmes muttered. \"It will engulf us soon, and then everything will be lost. This one thing could spoil my plans. But I hope we won't be waiting much longer. Ten o'clock. Sir Henry will leave any moment. This fog is a matter of life or death for him...\"\n\nThe night was clear; outside the range of the vapors, Merripit House was visible. Only two windows were lit. Then the light went out in the kitchen; only the dining room remained lit, where the murderer and his victim sat over drinks and cigars. Meanwhile, the fog covered an ever wider area, already touching Stapleton's house. The wall at the far end of the garden disappeared into it, the tops of the trees were still emerging from beyond the vapors. Holmes paced back and forth. He was worried.\n\n\"If he doesn't leave in a quarter of an hour, the whole operation is for nothing. In half an hour we won't be able to see our own hands...\"\n\nHe knelt down and put his ear to the ground.\n\n\"Thank God! I hear his footsteps...\" he whispered.\n\nA measured tread resounded. The footsteps grew louder and clearer, reaching us through the fog, as through a curtain, and suddenly the one we were waiting for appeared.\n\nHe walked past us along the path and went on, looking to the right and left as he went, with visible anxiety.\n\n\"Psst!\" Holmes whispered. \"Attention!\"\n\nThe fog was already fifty yards in front of us. We strained our eyes, feeling that something terrible would emerge from it. I looked at Holmes. He was pale, staring at one point, his lips trembling. At that moment Lestrade screamed and fell face down to the ground. I jumped up, not letting go of my pistol, although my blood ran cold at the sight of the terrible phenomenon that emerged from the fog...\n\nIt was a huge dog, black as coal, but not an ordinary dog. Its gaping jaws breathed fire, sparks flew from its eyes, its whole muzzle was as if in flames. The most terrifying nightmare could not be more terrifying than this hellish beast emerging towards us from the darkness.\n\nThe wild beast ran in leaps after our friend...\n\nWe were so terrified by this phenomenon that we didn't fire in time. The dog ran past us. Holmes and I fired simultaneously; the animal, visibly wounded, yelped terribly, but did not stop in its frenzied pursuit.\n\nSir Henry, who was already far away, looked back; I saw in the moonlight that he stood terrified and raised his hands to the sky.\n\nThe dog's yelp dispelled our superstitious fears. If the bullet had wounded the animal, then it was not a ghost, but reality – we could kill it.\n\nIn my life I have never seen anyone running as fast as Holmes did that night. I ran after him, but he overtook me. We heard the dog's growling and Sir Henry's cries for help ahead of us. I ran up at the moment when the enraged animal pounced on its victim, threw it to the ground and bared its teeth. With a wild howl and a moan of pain, the dying dog collapsed on the baronet.\n\nI jumped forward and put the pistol to the dog's head, but the shot was unnecessary. The four-legged persecutor of the Baskerville family was already dead...\n\nWe bent over Sir Henry. My friend breathed more freely, seeing that our help had come in time. Lestrade poured a few drops of vodka into the baronet's mouth. Sir Henry looked at us with terrified eyes.\n\n\"What was that?\" he whispered. \"What was that?...\"\n\n\"We killed the evil spirit of the Baskerville family. It will never live again!...\" exclaimed Holmes.\n\nAt our feet lay a huge dog, the size of a young lioness; it was a cross between a bloodhound and a mastiff. Its extinguished eyes still shone, its bloody muzzle breathed fire.\n\nI ran my hand over its shaggy head – my fingers gleamed in the dark...\n\n\"Phosphorus!\" I said.\n\n\"A devilish idea!\" said Holmes, leaning over the dead animal. \"I apologize most sincerely, Sir Henry, that I had to expose you to such fright. I suspected they would release the dog, but I didn't think they would first smear it with sulfur to make it seem like a hellish monster...\"\n\n\"You saved my life!\"\n\n\"By exposing it to danger. Can you stand up on your own?\"\n\n\"Give me some more vodka. Yes! And now support me for a moment, because my legs are still trembling. What are your orders now?\"\n\n\"First of all, you must rest. If you wait here for us, we will escort you home.\"\n\nSir Henry was still pale and could not stand on his feet. We seated him on a stone.\n\n\"Now to work,\" said Holmes. \"Every moment is precious. We already have evidence of the crime, it's still a matter of catching the criminal.\"\n\nWe left Sir Henry and headed towards Stapleton's house.\n\n\"He heard the shots and guessed that his 'trick' had been discovered. We won't find him there,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"Who knows: the thick fog probably muffled the sound of the revolvers, and besides, the distance is considerable; he may not have heard it.\"\n\n\"Do you think he waited for the result at home? You don't know him. I guarantee he went after the dog to call it back after the 'job' was finished. I'm ready to bet that he's not in Merripit House. By the way, we'll search the house from the attic to the cellar.\"\n",
  "The front door stood open; we entered, to the astonishment of the old servant who was standing in the hall.  Except for the dining room, everywhere was in darkness, but Holmes took a lamp from the table and went from room to room with it.  Stapleton was nowhere to be found.\n\nOne of the upstairs rooms was locked.\n\n“Someone’s in there!” cried Lestrade. “I can hear breathing. Please open the door!”\n\nA groan answered us. Holmes struck the handle with his fist; it sprang open, and the door flew wide. We rushed into the room, pistols in hand.\n\nStapleton was not there. A strange and unexpected sight met our eyes.\n\nThe room was a kind of museum; rare specimens of butterflies were displayed in cases and on the walls. In the middle of the room stood a pillar, presumably placed there to support an old beam threatening to collapse. To this pillar a human figure was tied; at first we could not tell whether it was a man or a woman. One towel was clutched around her throat and wound around the pillar, another covered the lower part of her face. The whole figure was shrouded in a sheet.\n\nIn a moment we had torn away the bonds; at our feet lay Mrs. Stapleton. Her throat was bruised and there were traces of fingernails on her face and body.\n\n“The scoundrel!” exclaimed Holmes indignantly. “Bring me that flask of brandy,” he said to Lestrade. “We must seat her on a chair and rub her down.”\n\nShe opened her eyes.\n\n“What happened to him?” she whispered. “Did he escape?”\n\n“He won’t get away so easily.”\n\n“I’m not talking about *him*, but about Sir Henry. Is he safe?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“And the hound?”\n\n“Dead.”\n\nShe breathed more freely.\n\n“Thank God! You gentlemen see how that villain treated me!...”\n\nShe pulled her hands from her sleeves – they were covered in bruises.\n\n“But that’s the least of it,” she continued. “He trampled on my soul, degraded me… I endured everything: loneliness, hardship, as long as I could believe in his love; but even there I was disappointed…”\n\nShe burst into tears.\n\n“You have no reason to spare him,” said Holmes. “Tell us where he is hiding? If you helped him in his evil, help us to redress the wrong.”\n\n“There’s only one place where he could have taken refuge: the old lead mine, in the heart of the mire. He kept the hound chained there; I know he made preparations to hide there.”\n\nHolmes held the lamp to the window.\n\n“Look,” he said, “what a fog! No one will be able to reach Grimpen Mire today.”\n\nShe clapped her hands. Her eyes flashed.\n\n“He’ll get there, but he won’t be able to get out, because in the fog he won’t see the branches we stuck in to guide him to Grimpen Mire. It’s a pity I couldn’t pull them out today, because he would be at your mercy…”\n\nThe pursuit became impossible until the fog lifted. Meanwhile, we left Lestrade on duty at Merripit House, and Sir Henry and I returned to Baskerville Hall.\n\nIt was no longer possible to hide the story of the Stapletons from him. He calmly accepted the news that the woman he loved was the wife, not the sister, of that villain. But the events of that night had shaken his nerves. He developed a fever. We sent for Dr. Mortimer.\n\nWhen the baronet got out of bed, to regain his mental equilibrium, under the care of that worthy doctor he embarked on a trip around the world. He returned healthy in body and mind.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nI am approaching the end of this strange story; I have tried to convey to the reader the anxieties that plagued us for so long and ended so tragically.\n\nThe day after the events described, the fog lifted and under the guidance of Mrs. Stapleton we were able to reach the point where the path led to the mire.\n\nThe unfortunate woman, with a zeal that testified to her deep resentment towards the man who had ruined her life and trampled on her womanhood, eagerly tried to lead us to his trail.\n\nFrom that point, a line of branches stuck into the mud indicated patches of firm ground where one could pass with dry feet. One wrong step could have cost us our lives. Only once did we see a sign that someone had passed along this dangerous path.  Among the weeds and grass, a black object peeked out.\n\nHolmes bent down to pick it up, and his foot slipped; if we hadn't supported him, he would have fallen into that bottomless mud. He got up holding an old boot in his hand. Inside, on the sole, was the imprint: “_Meyers, Toronto_”.\n\n“That was worth a mud bath!” he exclaimed. “This is Sir Henry’s missing boot.”\n\n“Stapleton probably dropped it during his escape.”\n\n“Undoubtedly. Holding this boot, he led the hound onto Sir Henry’s trail… The sound of the shot signaled to Stapleton that the ambush had failed. The villain fled with this boot in his hand. This is where he dropped it.  Therefore, he reached this point safely.”\n\nWe were to learn further details, although many things remained unexplained. It was impossible to find tracks in the bog, as the mud immediately covered them. Having passed the deepest mire, we looked for footprints on the firmer ground. In vain. If the evidence of the earth was reliable, Stapleton did not reach the island he was aiming for in the fog.\n\nGrimpen Mire had swallowed the wretch. His bones probably rest among the impassable quagmires…\n\nHowever, we found many traces of him on the island where he hid the hound. In one of the abandoned cottages there was a chain fastened to the wall; gnawed bones testified that the hound had been kept prisoner here. Nearby lay the skeleton of a small Pinscher.\n\n“Look! That’s Mortimer’s favorite!” exclaimed Holmes. “Stapleton managed to hide the hound, but he couldn’t stifle its howling. He could have kept it in the outbuilding at Merripit House, but that would have been risky. He decided on this step on the last day, when he staked everything on one card. The ointment in this tin is probably a mixture of sulfur and phosphorus, with which the hound was smeared. In this way, taking advantage of the legend, that villain scared Sir Charles to death. No wonder Seldon fled with a scream. After all, our friend Sir Henry, and we too, couldn’t help but cry out at such a sight. It was a hellish idea! – it was not only about frightening the victim, but also about hindering the investigation, for the hound, breathing fire, instilled superstitious fear in the local peasants and discouraged them from pursuing the monster. I told you this once in London, Watson, and now I repeat that Stapleton was the most dangerous villain I have ever encountered in my life.”\n\n\nXV.\n\nA Retrospective Glance.\n\n\nAt the end of November, Holmes and I, on a dark and rainy evening, sat by the fireplace in our sitting room on Baker Street. My friend was in excellent spirits, and I took advantage of this to question him about the details of the Baskerville case that were still unknown to me.\n\nSir Henry and Dr. Mortimer were staying in London, preparing for a long journey that was intended to strengthen the baronet’s nerves.\n\n“The whole thing was clear and simple from the point of view of the alleged Stapleton,” said Holmes, in response to my question. “For us, however, who did not know his motives and goals, it seemed mysterious and complex. You will find my views under the letter _B_ in my criminal records.”\n\n“I would prefer you to tell me about it in your own words.”\n\n“Very well, but I don’t guarantee accuracy. My memory may be failing me. Well, my research revealed that the family portrait did not mislead us. This villain was the son of Roger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir Charles; he emigrated to America with a very bad reputation. There he married Beryl Garcia, the most beautiful woman in Costa Rica, and having embezzled a considerable sum from public funds, changed his name to Vandeleur, fled to England, and founded a school for boys in Yorkshire. He was prompted to choose this profession by an acquaintance made on his return journey with a consumptive teacher, a certain Fraser. They went into partnership. As long as Fraser lived, the school did well and was run with a sense of civic duty, but after his death it gained the worst possible reputation and finally became infamous. Vandeleur found it appropriate to change his name. As Stapleton, with the remnants of the stolen money and a beautiful entomological collection, he moved to southern England.”\n\nThe British Museum informed me that he was an authority in the field of entomology; he discovered many species that bear the name Vandeleur.\n\nThis scoundrel had probably investigated his family relationships and learned that only one human life stood between him and a huge fortune. I suppose that when he settled in Devonshire he did not yet have a clearly defined plan; but the fact that he presented his wife as his sister shows that he harbored evil intentions from the beginning.  He evidently already had a plan to use her as a tool, although he did not yet know how he would achieve his goal.\n\nFirst of all, he tried to settle as close as possible to the seat of his ancestors, secondly – to establish friendly relations with Sir Charles Baskerville, and with his neighbors.\n\nThe baronet himself told him about the hound that haunted their family, and thereby prepared his own terrible death. Stapleton – for so I shall continue to call him – knew that Sir Charles had a heart defect and that a violent shock could kill him; he also knew that he was superstitious and that he believed in the legend.\n\nThe villain immediately recognized the advantage he could gain from this; he devised an infallible death for the baronet, for which no one could be held responsible.\n\nHe carried out his plan very cleverly. An ordinary villain would have used a raging dog – he gave it the appearance of a hellish beast. He bought the wildest and largest hound he could get from Ross and Mangles in London. He brought it to North Devon station, far from Baskerville Hall, and covered a huge distance, walking through meadows and marshes, so that no one would notice him. First, he found a shelter for it in Grimpen Mire and immediately introduced it there. He kept it chained and waited for an opportunity. But it wasn't easy to find one.\n\nThe old baronet never went outside the palace after sunset. Several times Stapleton lay in wait for him with the hound, but without success.  It was then that the local peasants saw the huge hound, which led to the revival of the legend.\n\nStapleton hoped that his wife would be able to lead Sir Charles to his doom, but he met with unexpected resistance. She didn't want to entice the old gentleman; neither threats nor even sticks could induce her to such a wicked partnership. Stapleton had to act alone.\n\nSir Charles's benevolence helped him. The worthy old man, misled by appearances, liked Stapleton and through him did much good, including for Mrs. Laura Lyons. Stapleton met her by chance, pretended to be interested in her fate, and aroused compassion for her in the baronet's merciful heart; and since he was able to win the favor of women and presented himself as a bachelor, he soon gained not only the trust but also the heart of the beautiful Laura; he also gave her to understand that he would marry her if she divorced her husband.\n\nHaving heard that Sir Charles, on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, intended to leave Baskerville Hall, he decided to act immediately, fearing that the victim would slip from his clutches. He therefore induced Mrs. Lyons to write a letter in which she begged the baronet to come to the garden gate on the eve of his departure for London. Then he dissuaded her from appearing at the appointed place.\n\nReturning in the evening from Coombe Tracey, he unleashed the hound, smeared it with phosphorus, and led it to the gate, knowing that the old gentleman would appear there from the side of the palace.\n\nThe hound, urged on by its master, jumped over the gate and chased the poor baronet; he fled down the avenue, calling for help. The hound ran across the lawn, the baronet down the gravel path; therefore only his footprints remained.\n\nSeeing that he lay motionless, the hound probably approached, sniffed him, and when it felt that he was dead, turned back. Stapleton called it, led it to the makeshift kennel in Grimpen Mire, and chained it up again.\n\nSir Charles's death remained unexplained; the police were puzzled about its cause, the area was in fear, and finally the case was handed over to us.\n\nYou understand the hellish cunning of this villain; he arranged things so that it was impossible to find traces of the crime, or to prosecute the murderer. His only accomplice could not betray him. Both women involved in this affair: Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, had certain suspicions; Mrs. Stapleton even knew about her husband's evil intentions towards Sir Charles, and also about the existence of the hound. Mrs. Lyons, however, had no idea of either, but she was surprised that the old gentleman's death occurred at the hour appointed for the meeting with her. However, both women were under the influence of this villain – he had no reason to fear betrayal from them.\n\nThe first part of the satanic task was accomplished, the second, more difficult one remained.\n\nStapleton may not have known about the existence of an heir in Canada for a while. In any case, he learned about it soon after Sir Charles's death from his friend, Dr. Mortimer, who also informed him of Sir Henry's arrival.\n\nStapleton's first thought was probably to eliminate him in London. He lost confidence in his wife from the moment she refused to help him set a trap for Sir Charles. However, he was afraid to leave her alone for a long time, so he took her with him to London.\n\nI discovered that they were staying at the Mexborough Hotel, in Craven Street. Stapleton locked his wife up and, having disguised his beard, secretly followed Dr. Mortimer's every step, following him to Baker Street, then to the station and to the Northumberland Hotel.\n\nHis wife suspected his plans, but was afraid to warn the intended victim. If the letter fell into Stapleton's hands, her own life would be in danger.\n\nAs we know, she hit upon the idea of cutting out the words from the newspaper that warned the baronet. The letter reached the baronet and was the first warning of danger.\n\nStapleton tried to obtain Sir Henry's boot, so that if necessary he could use the hound's scent and lead it to the victim's trail.\n\nA hotel servant provided him with footwear, probably for a generous fee; but the first boot stolen was new; Stapleton had it planted and received a second, worn one. This small fact immediately led me to guess that Sir Henry's persecutor intended to use the hound for his purposes.\n\nThe next day the baronet arrived here; Stapleton followed him in a carriage. Judging from the fact that he knew me and knew where I lived, I am ready to assume that he had previously had reason to fear my investigative activity and that he was not a novice in the field of crime.\n\nIn the last three years, four manor houses have been robbed in Devonshire. In no case were the criminals apprehended. Finally, in May of this year, Folkstone Court was robbed, and the servant who first spotted the masked thief was killed.\n\nI could vouch that it was Stapleton, who in this way replenished his funds. We had proof of his audacity in the fact that he gave my name to the cab driver. He then understood that I was following him and that he would not be able to carry out his plans in London. He returned to Devonshire and waited there for the baronet's arrival.\n\n“Excuse me,” I said. “Could you explain to me who fed the hound during Stapleton's stay in London?”\n\n“That’s an important question,” he replied. “I thought about it and came to the conclusion that Stapleton had an accomplice. There was an old servant, Anthony, at Merripit House. I know that he had been in his service for at least several years, because he was seen during the time when Stapleton was headmaster of the school in Yorkshire. This man must have known that Beryl was his master's wife, not his sister. After the attempt on Sir Henry, Anthony disappeared without a trace.\n\nNow, that name, rare in England, is very common in Spain and Spanish America. That servant, as well as Mrs. Stapleton, spoke English fluently, but with a soft, southern accent. I myself saw Anthony walking to Grimpen Mire along the path marked out by Stapleton. Presumably, he fed the hound during his absence, although he probably didn't know what purpose it was intended for.\n\nNow a word about my activities while you were staying with Sir Henry at Baskerville Hall. Do you remember, when examining the paper on which the words cut from the *Times* were pasted, I examined the watermark; I held the paper close to my eyes.  Well, a subtle scent of white jasmine reached me.\n\nThere are seventy-five types of perfume that every detective should be able to distinguish; many cases depend on the quick recognition of perfume. Jasmine led me to guess that the letter had been sent by a woman. Even then, my suspicions turned to the Stapletons.\n\nSo I knew about the existence of the hound and the murderer's residence before you left for Devonshire.\n\nI decided to follow Stapleton. Of course, I couldn't do that while staying with you, because the villain would be on his guard. I misled everyone, including you, and secretly appeared when you all thought I was staying in London.\n\nI mostly hid in Coombe Tracey, taking refuge in a cave in the marshes only when my presence on the scene was necessary. Cartwright, disguised as a village boy, rendered me considerable service. He supplied me with food and clean linen. While I was following Stapleton, he was following you, so I knew your every move.\n\nI have already told you that your reports reached me quickly; they were sent to me immediately from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey. They were very useful to me, especially Stapleton's biography. It helped me to uncover his identity and his relationship with the beautiful companion.\n\nThe case was complicated by the escape of the prisoner Seldon and his dealings with the Barrymores. And you untangled that complication, although I also arrived at the same conclusion, based on my own observations.\n\nAt the moment you found me in the marshes, I already had all the threads of the conspiracy in my hand, but I did not have the evidence with which I could stand before the court.\n\nEven the attempt on Sir Henry, which ended with the death of Seldon, the unfortunate prisoner, could not help us to prove Stapleton's guilt.\n\nThere was no other way but to catch him in the act, and for that purpose I had to use Sir Henry, at the risk of his nerves. I admit that it is my fault: the case should have been conducted differently and our client spared this unpleasantness, but I could not foresee that the villain would smear the hound with sulfur and that there would be fog that night, thanks to which Sir Henry could not see from a distance Stapleton's four-legged accomplice, who jumped out unexpectedly and frightened that brave man. Besides, Dr. Mortimer and the specialists called in assure us that our friend will soon regain his balance and that he will regain the peace of mind, shaken not only by this incident but also by the disappointment in love.\n\nIt only remains for me to note the role of Mrs. Stapleton. Her husband exerted a demonic influence over her; it is unknown whether she loved him more or feared him. In any case, she obeyed him slavishly, resisting him only when he wanted to force her to complicity in the crime. She wanted to warn Sir Henry without endangering her husband; she tried several times, but unsuccessfully.\n\nStapleton was capable of jealousy: seeing that the baronet was courting his wife, although it was in his plans, he could not, however, restrain himself from a violent outburst. Having recovered, he pretended to favor the developing feeling, invited Sir Henry to Merripit House, hoping that sooner or later an opportunity would arise to lure him into an ambush.\n\nSuddenly, on the day designated for the attack, his wife declared herself against him. She heard news of the sudden death of the escaped prisoner in the marshes, and since she knew that the hound was kept chained there, she guessed what death Stapleton was preparing for Sir Henry, especially when her husband brought the hound and locked it in the outbuilding.\n",
  "One evening, before Sir Henry's arrival for dinner, a quarrel erupted between the spouses. Beryl called her husband a criminal; enraged, wanting to hurt her deeply, he declared his love for another woman.\n\nThis brutal confession shattered the last bonds connecting her to the wretch and ignited in her heart hatred and a thirst for revenge.\n\nHe noticed this change, and fearing betrayal, tied her to a pillar and locked her up. He was certain that after the crime was committed, when the entire neighborhood attributed Sir Henry's death to a curse on his family, he, Stapleton, with skillful lies and flattery, would regain his wife's affection, persuade her to remain silent, and accept the accomplished facts.\n\nIn this he would undoubtedly be disappointed. A woman with Spanish blood in her veins does not forget such an insult.\n\nThat's all I know about this intriguing case. Only one thing remains to be clarified: how would Stapleton, having succeeded to the inheritance, explain his long residence near Baskerville Hall under an assumed name? How would he claim the inheritance without arousing suspicion?\n\nMrs. Stapleton testifies that her husband had several plans in this regard: either to claim the inheritance from South America and there prove his identity and obtain the fortune without coming to England; or to provide a partner with the necessary documents and receive the inheritance through him; or to conduct the matter himself on the spot, but under a different outward appearance, in such disguise that no one could recognize him. Knowing him, I'm sure he would have overcome these difficulties.\n\nAnd now, my dear fellow, enough about this matter. It has cost us a great deal of effort. We deserve some entertainment.  They're performing \"The Huguenots\" tonight. I've taken a box. Have you ever heard Reszke? Let's get dressed at once and go to a first-class restaurant for dinner before the performance. Agreed?...\n\n\n                        The End.\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\n[Note 1: _Mire_ -- mud.]\n\n\nCORRECTIONS\n\n\n[Correction A: =Correction.= On page 35, lines 14 and 13 from the bottom, replace:\n\"Only one word: 'bogs' was written in printed letters, in ink,\" -- with: \"Only one word: 'bogs' was written in ink, the rest in printed letters.\" ]\n\n[Correction B: =Correction.= On page 189, in the previous addendum, a printing error occurred: instead of \"the dead body of Sir _Charles_ Baskerville,\" -- it should be: \"the dead body of Sir _Henry_ Baskerville.\"]\n\n\nNOTES ON THE ELECTRONIC EDITION\n\n\nThe original spelling and punctuation have been preserved, even where they differed from contemporary usage.
