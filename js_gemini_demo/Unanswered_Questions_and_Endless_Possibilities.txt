The Generative AI space is evolving at a breakneck speed, leaving us with a series
of unanswered questions and exciting possibilities. As we look towards the future,
three major themes are dominating my thoughts these days: content consumption,
content creation, and task execution. More specifically, what do these look like in a
future fueled by Generative AI?

(1) Unanswered Questions and Endless Possibilities

1. Content Consumption: A
Transformed Landscape
It’s becoming clear that in the next few years, the way we interact with online
content - whether it be through websites, mobile apps, or something different - will
undergo a radical transformation. Generative AI, coupled with a deep

understanding of user intent, will pave the way for more adaptive and personalized
end-user experiences.
Imagine ordering a pizza online. Instead of navigating through menus and options,
a website could intuit your intent and surface relevant content immediately
creating a custom experience tailored to you, and the context of that specific visit.
This shift from pre-defined interfaces to adaptive, user-centric experiences will
redefine content consumption as we know it.

2. Content Creation: From Ideas to
Immersive Experiences
With the surge in content consumption, the question arises: how will this content
be created? The future of content creation feels like it will lie in tools that
seamlessly blend different types of input - from unstructured thoughts, and audio
files, to video clips, and other creative fragments, into engaging, multi-modal
formats.
Think of a journalist crafting a news story. Instead of a traditional text-based
article, they might utilize a platform that weaves together voice recordings, video
snippets, and handwritten notes to create a truly immersive and interactive
experience for the reader (that can then be personalized when an end-user sees it,
as mentioned above).

3. Task Execution: An Army of Agents
at Your Service
Beyond consumption and creation, the execution of tasks also feels ripe for a new
paradigm shift, revolutionized by AI. Let’s take the simple task of having to plan
your child's birthday party (something top of mind for me right now). Instead of
juggling multiple websites and to-do lists, you could delegate tasks to an army of

AI agents. These agents would search for themes, order supplies, send invitations,
and even book a cake, all while keeping you informed of their progress.
This agent-based framework would streamline task management and extend
beyond personal use cases to various industries, improving efficiency and
productivity across the board.

The Road Ahead: Uncharted Territory
and Boundless Potential
The Generative AI landscape is still in its early stages, but the potential is
undeniable. As we grapple with these unanswered questions and explore new
possibilities, one thing is clear: the future of content and the way we interact with
it will be shaped by the power of AI. The journey ahead is uncharted, but the
possibilities are boundless.

Thank you for this thought-provoking blog post. While generative AI currently shows
promise in creating articles similar to a journalist, it's intriguing to consider its potential for
investigative journalism. Imagine if AI could go beyond summarizing existing information
and conduct its own research, delving into hidden corners and uncovering the truth.
The success of Bellingcat demonstrates the power of open-source data in investigative
reporting. Many issues remain concealed due to insufficient scrutiny, but an AI-powered
investigative journalist, operating within an agent-based framework, could change this

profound.
