            "\n",
            "Early in my career, I was obsessed with the final product. I poured hours into visions, roadmaps, and meticulously planned projects.  Coming straight from school, I was wired to believe that an assignment, once given, had to be executed perfectly. There were no \"take-backsies.\" You got the brief, you delivered, and you were graded on it.\n",
            "\n",
            "The reality of the workforce hit me hard.  Projects got scrapped. Priorities shifted.  Sometimes, entire initiatives were killed weeks, even months, into development. And, to be honest, it felt like a colossal waste of time. All that effort, all those late nights, for *nothing*. I struggled to reconcile this with my ingrained belief that every task needed to have a tangible, lasting output. None of it might matter at the end of the day. None of it might be used.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sound familiar?\n",
            "\n",
            "It took me a while to get over that initial frustration. But it wasn't until recently, joining a new team with a strong culture of \"Write to Think,\" that I truly understood the value of all that \"wasted\" effort.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Write to Think\" flips the script on traditional productivity.  It's not simply about acknowledging that priorities change and things get cut (although that's part of it). It's about recognizing that the act of *creation itself* is the valuable part. The content you produce, even if it never sees the light of day, is an essential part of the process of becoming better at what you do. It’s honing your skills, sharpening your understanding, and refining your ideas.\n",
            "\n",
            "This means embracing the mess. It means writing more, writing earlier, and writing often. But, crucially, it means writing without the pressure of needing to produce a perfect, polished final product every time. It means being willing to scrap it and move on once it's served its purpose – to clarify your thinking.\n",
            "\n",
            "How do we extend this way of thinking to all aspects of our work? Or, how do we speed up that learning and growing?\n",
            "\n",
            "The \"Write to Think\" culture answers this by encouraging us to *write more*. Not necessarily *do* more, but *write* more.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's what that looks like in practice:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Early & Often:** Don't wait until you have a fully formed idea. Start writing as soon as you have a glimmer. The act of writing will help you flesh it out.\n",
            "*   **Embrace Imperfection:** The goal isn't to create a masterpiece every time. It's to explore ideas, challenge assumptions, and refine your thinking.\n",
            "*   **Don't Be Afraid to Kill Your Darlings:** If something isn't working, let it go. The time wasn't wasted – it helped you get closer to the right answer (or, at least, eliminate a wrong one).\n",
            "\n",
            "The \"Write to Think\" philosophy ties in nicely with iterative processes and \"learning by doing.\" But it offers a powerful reframe: there's no such thing as \"throwaway work.\" It's all contributing to your growth and development.\n",
            "\n",
            "I’m constantly talking about it and going back on it.\n",
